Dinwiddle exercises regularly to keep up with the athletic lifestyle.</p><p>Further, the American player stands 1.96 m tall and weighs around 215 lb. Unfortunately, the player’s other body measurements are currently unknown.</p><p>Spencer does not have any tattoos inked on his body yet. Additionally, the player’s black hair and brown eyes complement his personality all and all.&nbsp;</p><h2><span id=High_school_career class=mw-headline>High School Career</span></h2><p>Spencer Dinwiddie was regarded as the finest standout athlete at William Howard Taft High School since Jordan Farmar.</p><p>At the end of his junior season, he averaged 5.9 points and 4.1 assists as the starting point guard with fellow 2014 draftee DeAndre Daniels.</p><p>Spencer improved his skills as he entered his last year at the school, averaging 11.2 points and 7.7 assists per game.</p><p>Likewise, in 2011, the player was named the John R. Wooden California High School Player of the Year after being one of the most talented passers in school history.</p><p>On the other hand, Long Beach Poly’s Ryan Anderson was awarded California Mr. Basketball. The player was one of just seven seniors to receive the coveted award.</p><h2>College Career</h2><p>Spencer made his collegiate debut in the opening regular-season game for Colorado.</p><p>He scored seven points and grabbed seven rebounds in a 32-point victory over Fort Lewis.&nbsp;</p><p>Spencer scored twice in his sixth appearance, which came against Georgia. This was the first time he shot better than .500 on field goals.</p><p>The California native rallied the squad to victory, making three crucial free throws in the final seconds.</p><p>Spencer formed another duo on his new team with fellow freshman Askia Booker. They combined for 677 points, making school history by scoring over 250 points each.</p><p>The American player pitched a perfect game against Oregon State on February 10, 2012. He went 6-for-6 from the field, 4-for-4 from the arc, and 8-for-8 on free throws.</p><p>This set a new school record for the most points scored in a single game without missing a single shot.&nbsp;</p><p>Spencer served as the Colorado Buffaloes men’s basketball team leader until the start of his junior year.</p><p>He helped the team win 14 of their first 16 regular-season games, making them one of the most successful underdogs in the country, notably defeating the Kansas Jayhawks.</p><p>Spencer was the catalyst for his team’s unexpected success. He hit a career-high 14-for-15 from the free-throw line against Santa Barbara on November 21, 2012.</p><p>Colorado won every game whose leading scorer scored 20 or more points. However, Spencer suffered a career-threatening ACL injury against Washington on January 12, 2014. The injury caused him to miss the rest of the season.</p><h2>Professional Career</h2><h3><span id=Detroit_Pistons_(2014–2016) class=mw-headline>Detroit Pistons</span></h3><p>The Detroit Pistons took Spencer with the 38th overall pick in the 2014 NBA Draft.</p><p>As a rookie, he played 34 games with the Pistons, making one start and getting two assignments to the Pistons’ D-League team, the Grand Rapids Drive.</p><p>His lone start occurred on February 20, 2015, when the Pistons were shorthanded due to a pair of transactions.</p><p>In a 100–91 victory over the Chicago Bulls, the player set career highs with 12 points and nine assists.&nbsp;</p><p>Eight days later, in a 99–95 defeat to the Washington Wizards, he had a season-high 20 points and eight assists in 25 minutes off the bench.</p><p>Spencer appeared in just 12 regular-season games with the Pistons in 2015–16, after spending the rest of the season with the Grand Rapids Drive in the D-League.&nbsp;</p><p>After starting the season with a horrible shooting slump, Dinwiddie had his first opportunity in the tenth game, scoring 17 points in a 97–85 defeat to the Lakers on November 15, 2015.&nbsp;</p><p>However, after failing in the next four games, he was dropped from the rotation, exacerbated by Blake’s improved form and Brandon Jennings’ return from injury.</p><h3>Windy City Bulls</h3><p>Spencer Dinwiddie was traded with the Chicago Bulls for Cameron Bairstow on June 17, 2016.</p><p>After participating in five preseason games, he was released by the Bulls on July 7, re-signed on July 28, and then waived again on October 21.</p><p>He subsequently played the first nine games of the 2016–17 season with Chicago’s D-League affiliate team, the Windy City Bulls, averaging 19.4 points, 8.1 assists, and 3.7 rebounds in 37.4 minutes.</p><h3>Brooklyn Nets</h3><p>Spencer signed with the Brooklyn Nets on December 8, 2016. He scored 15 of his season-high 19 points in the fourth quarter of the Nets’ 129–125 defeat against the Milwaukee Bucks on February 15, 2017.&nbsp;</p><p>The player ended with 19 points and four free throws in the final 13.6 seconds in a 107–106 win over the Chicago Bulls on April 8, 2017.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Spencer-Dinwiddie-playing-basketball.jpg><p>Spencer began the 2019–20 NBA season as a reserve before <a href=# rel=noopener>Kyrie Irving</a> hurt his shoulder.</p><p>He also changed his uniform number from 8 to 26 on January 28, 2020, in honor of the late <a href=# rel=noopener>Kobe Bryant</a>, aligning with the NBA’s agreement.&nbsp;</p><p>On June 29, 2020, Spencer revealed he had tested positive for COVID-19.&nbsp;</p><h3>Washington Wizards</h3><p>Spencer was acquired by the Wizards in a five-teams sign-and-trade on August 6, 2021, sending <a href=# rel=noopener>Russell Westbrook</a> to the Los Angeles Lakers.</p><p>The player agreed to a three-year contract of $54 million with a potential incentive payment of $60 million.</p><h3>Dallas Mavericks</h3><p>Spencer Dinwiddie and Davis Bertns were transferred to the Dallas Mavericks on February 10, 2022, for Kristaps Porziis and a protected 2022 second-round selection.</p><h3>Return To Brooklyn</h3><p>The Mavericks traded Spencer and Dorian Finney-Smith to Brooklyn Nets on February 6, 2023, to acquire Kyrie Irving and Markieff Morris.</p><p>Moreover, from the trade, the Nets also got rights to the Mavericks’ unprotected 2029 first-round pick and second-round picks in 2027 and 2029.</p><h2>National Team Career</h2><p>Dinwiddie was in the USA Basketball Men’s World University Games in 2013 at the Summer Universiade in Kazan, Russia.</p><p>He was one of three Team USA players in all eight games. Spencer led team USA with 44 assists (5.5 APG) and 12 steals, averaging 7.9 points and 2.6 rebounds per game (1.5 SPG).&nbsp;</p><p>However, on April 19, 2020, the player announced he wanted to play for the Nigerian national team.</p><h2>Cryptocurrency & “Human Tokenization”</h2><p>Dinwiddie introduced cryptocurrency to the NBA by launching his DREAM Fan Shares, allowing accredited investors to use digital tokens to invest in Dinwiddie’s three-year, $34 million guaranteed contract.</p><p>He was planning to sell ninety “SD8” tokens at $150,000 each, allowing him to raise $13.5 million.</p><p>The NBA strongly opposed it when he first announced it in September 2019; in January 2020, he was still negotiating with the NBA.</p><p>The initial stances included a threat to ban Dinwiddie from the league, citing language in Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) Article 2.13 (d) (prohibiting athletes from transferring their right to a third party.)&nbsp;</p><p>However, the project only raised $1.35 million in tokens, 10% of his initial target.</p><p>Dinwiddie later realized crypto tokens often represent something vaguer it doesn’t need to be backed by his contract. So he went for his new project, “The Creator’s Galaxy.”</p><h2>Chairman & CEO Of Calaxy</h2><p>Calaxy is a social media platform that Spencer is creating for artists. It was founded in 2020 by basketball player Spencer Dinwiddie and ex-financier Solo Ceesay.</p><p>Spencer hopes to enable more meaningful and gratifying fan interactions by providing creators with a toolset for interacting with their followers in one location and rewarding fans for their participation.</p><p>The startup received $26 million in funding on June 7, 2022, with noteworthy investors, including NFL star <a href=# rel=noopener>Ezekiel Elliott</a> and The Bachelor’s Matt James.</p><p>Teyana Taylor, an entertainment celebrity, and NBA champion <a href=# rel=noopener>Iman Shumpert</a> are among the other significant names associated.</p><h2>Who Is Spencer Dinwiddie’s Girlfriend?</h2><p>Spencer Dinwiddie’s girlfriend is Arielle Roberson.
