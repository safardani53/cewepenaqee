It was a car with foreign plates pulling a caravan. It didn’t look to be slowing down.</p><p>“I had about two seconds to react.”</p><p>Sonia Thomson, from Staffordshire, was driving in the outside lane of the motorway when the realised the Subaru "was just heading towards me".</p><p>Ms Thomson, who works as cabin crew for British Airways, told the Press Association the car was "going so fast" and "it was almost past me in the blink of an eye".</p><p>She said the crash happened shortly after her encounter with the car, adding: "Someone must have been looking after me because 10-20 seconds later and that could have been me."</p><p>Others spoke of their shock at seeing the caravan travelling the wrong way before the crash happened on the M40 between junction 7 and 6.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/caravan2.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/caravan3.png><p>Liz Hindmarsh tweeted: "My husband had to swerve into the middle lane otherwise he’d have been hit by the caravan travelling the wrong way down the M40 in the outside (fast) lane."</p><p>Oliver Hayes said: "We also had to swerve, seemed at least 70mph driving head on in our lane at junction 8. Scary stuff...hope no fatalities."</p><p>Lucy Townson was also caught up in the incident. She wrote: "This caravan came hurtling towards me going the wrong way in the fast lane on the M40 today! Just managed to get out of its way with seconds to spare...scary stuff! Other people don’t appear to have been so lucky."</p><p>Senior investigating officer Sergeant Beth Walton, from the Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: “We are in the early stages of the investigation, in which sadly three people died and our thoughts are with their families.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN NEWS</h2></p><p>"We are in the process of contacting witnesses who provided a report to us and are grateful for their support."</p><p>The carriageway was closed while emergency services attended and resurfacing work took place.
