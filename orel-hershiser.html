Furthermore, his father was a baseball coach and league administrator, and not to mention, his mother used to manage a snack bar they owned.</p><p>Additionally, Hershiser’s family migrated from tons of places; the first they did was when he was just six as they shifted to Detroit in Michigan.</p><p>Followed by it, they again shifted to Toronto, Canada, when he was twelve, and a few years later, they moved to New Jersey.</p><h3>Education and Amateur Games</h3><p>Hershiser had a keen interest in the games ever since his childhood; that is why he started quite early at his school level. Hence, he competed in inter-school competitions and state level.</p><p>Therewith, we can conclude that he had a strong foundation in games as he claimed the third position in a hit, run, and throws competition held at the national level while he was an eight-year-old boy.</p><p>Before his shift at the age of twelve, he invested him in Little League Baseball, and when they moved to Canada, he commenced ice hockey.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Little-League-Baseball.jpg><p>Back then, he played for the Don Mills Flyers in the Greater Toronto Hockey League.

Infact, he stood as an all-conference selection, thanks to his perfect records during his years.</p><h4>College</h4><p>However, as he enrolled in the Bowling Green State University, his academic areas were poor, making him ineligible to play baseball.</p><p>Therefore, he was up for the partial scholarship only, which made him hopeless to quit schooling.</p><p>Having said it, he did quit; instead, he took summer classes and started upgrading his studies while working for his father’s paper company.</p><p>During the same interval, he improvised his game skill by adding 5 miles per hour (8.0 km/h) to his fastball as his gained weight (15 pounds / 6.8 kg) helped him.</p><p>Afterward, he commenced his gameplay against the Kent State on May 4, 1979, where he recorded a no-hitter with an all-Mid-American Conference All-Star team. He struck two batters in the whole game and won the match with a 2-0 win.</p><h2>Orel Hershiser | Professional Career</h2><h3>Minor League Career</h3><p>After getting excited for a hoax of getting into minor league, he was selected by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 17th round of the 1979 Major League Baseball draft.</p><p>His report was questionable about his skills, which started him to have a weak fastball, incorrect curveball, and made an easy mistake.</p><p>Hereby, Hershiser made his professional debut with the Class A farm team in the Midwest League, the Clinton Dodgers.</p><p>During the tenure, he had featured in 11 games, out of which he started four of them, thus finishing the 1979 season with a 4–0 record with a 2.09 ERA.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Minor-League-1024x683.jpg><p>For the next season in 1980, Orel was assigned to the San Antonio Dodgers of the Texas League in AA, where he appeared as a reliever (a pitcher).</p><p>According to Hershiser, this season came as his lowest as he had forgone 20 runs in seven innings, due to which he was feeling to quit. However, his managers were supportive enough to keep him going on.</p><p>Afterward, in 1982, he advanced to the Triple-A&nbsp;Albuquerque Dukes&nbsp;of the&nbsp;Pacific Coast League, and for the very season, he started seven games out of 47 and posted a 3.71 ERA.</p><p>The following year in 1983, Hershiser was titled the top rookie for the spring training and bagged the Mulvey Award.</p><p>Right after it, he was sent to Albuquerque, where he starred in a total of 49 games, starting 10 games as he recorded a 4.09 ERA for the Dukes.

His first win came on April 5 in a 12-inning game against the St. Louis Cardinals that season.</p><p></p><p>After tons of verbal lashing, Orel started getting tough, only allowing one run during May’s gameplay. At the same time, he became the full-fledged starter in the Dodger rotation after the injury of Jerry Reuss.</p><p>By the end of the season, he had started 20 games out of the total 45 games he played, where he maintained a 2.66 ERA.</p><h4>The Year 1985</h4><p>Right in the year 1985, he had his first start in the National League, where he had a big winning streak as he maintained a record of 19-3 with a 2.03 ERA.</p><p>On the one hand, Hershiser led the Dodgers to win the NL West and stood third in the Cy Young Award voting.
