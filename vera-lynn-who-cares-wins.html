I wish you the best of luck.”</p><p>The spirit of the Blitz is very much here, as retired doctors and nurses return to work to help out.</p><span class=quote-credit>Vera Lynn</span><p>Dame Vera was among the 24million Brits who watched the rare address by Her Majesty.</p><p>Speaking from her home in Ditchling, East Sussex, Dame Vera told The Sun: “I watched the speech, which was wonderful, but I didn’t know she was going to finish with the words, ‘We will meet again’.</p><p>“I have met the Queen on a number of occasions. You have to have something and someone we can look up to and rely on in times of trouble — and Her Majesty is that person.”</p><p>The Queen ended her moving address by saying: “We should take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will return.</p><p>“We will be with our friends again. We will be with our families again. We will meet again.”</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The powerful words left many of those watching in tears</a> — and the song from which her parting line comes has struck a chord with a new generation.</p><p>Dame Vera’s recording of We’ll Meet Again began to shoot up the charts, soaring 689 places to 22 with iTunes by Monday afternoon.</p><p>And bookies Coral offered odds of 2-1 that the weepy will go on to TOP the charts.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Give now to The Sun's NHS appeal</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/tp-composite-who-cares-wins-1.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>BRITAIN’s four million NHS staff are on the frontline in the battle against coronavirus.</p><p>But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them?</p><p>The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £1MILLION for NHS workers.</p><p>The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.</p><p>We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid-19 Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.</p><p>The Sun is donating £50,000 and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.</p><p>No matter how little you can spare, please donate today here</p><p>www.<a href=# data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://thesun.co.uk/whocareswinsappeal&source=gmail&ust=1586026721907000&usg=AFQjCNG02gQh1-TpDTj27ustTNMPQR-BLw" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-mce-href="https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?pageId=1157115">thesun.co.uk/whocareswinsappeal</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/tp-composite-who-cares-wins-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000575500030.jpg><p>Co-written in 1939 by Ross Parker and Hughie Charles, the recording by Dame Vera became one of the most-loved songs of World War Two — an anthem for Forces personnel going off to fight and for the families and sweethearts that were left behind in Blighty.</p><p>Its heartfelt lyrics include the lines: “We’ll meet again — don’t know where, don’t know when — but I know we’ll meet again some sunny day.”</p><p>Dame Vera went on to star in a 1943 musical film named after the song.</p><p>And in 2005 she performed it in the capital on the 60th anniversary of VE Day, May 8, to mark the Allies’ victory in Europe.</p><p>Some of her other popular songs include <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">(There’ll Be Bluebirds Over) The White Cliffs Of Dover</a>, A Nightingale Sang In Berkeley Square and There’ll Always Be an England.</p><p>The plumber’s daughter was born on March 20, 1917, in East Ham, East London, as the First World War raged.</p><p>Aged seven she was singing in working men’s clubs and she was talent-spotted at 15 by local band leader Howard Baker while singing at Poplar Baths.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000309469165.jpg><p>In 1936, when she was 19, she had her first solo record, Up The Wooden Hill To Bedfordshire.</p><p>By 22 she had sold more than a million records and earned enough to buy her parents a house and herself a car.</p><p>But it was during World War Two that she secured her place in national legend, reaching iconic status with her inspirational performances.</p><p>Dame Vera said of We’ll Meet Again: “It’s a good song, as it goes with anyone, anywhere, saying goodbye to someone.”</p><p>She travelled the world playing morale-boosting concerts to troops as far afield as Myanmar (then Burma), India and Egypt.</p><p>That could mean roughing it — sometimes staying in grass huts with a bucket of water as a shower.</p><p>Dame Vera told The Sun: “I had many highlights in my career.

We’re not superheroes, as everyone is saying.</p><p>“We are human.
