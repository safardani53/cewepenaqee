While making a name for herself in the industry, Solange also thrived as a single working mother, successfully raising her son <strong>Daniel Julez Smith Jr</strong>, who goes by the name Julez. Find out all about Solange’s only child, below!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Solange-Son-Daniel-Spl-embed.jpg><h2>Solange had Julez when she was a teenager.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-3>The Grammy-winner gave birth to her only child, Julez, on October 18, 2004. At the time, Solange was 18, having become pregnant with her high school sweetheart, <strong>Daniel Julez Smith</strong>. The new parents had married when Solange was 17, only to divorce two years later.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Solange spoke out about being a single working mother to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Brooklyn </a>magazine in 2013, calling the experience a “balancing act.” At the time, she was recording an album during the hours Julez was going to school. “I do the best I can, which involves a lot of saying no to things, actually, and a lot of really organized scheduling and a lot of help, to be honest,” the singer said. She also touched upon the importance of having her family — including Beyonce and their mother<strong> Tina Knowles </strong>— living nearby, admitting, “It’s such a beautiful feeling, but also having that village is a necessary reality so that I’m able to pursue my passion both outside of motherhood and outside of my career.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Solange went on to date music director <strong>Alan Ferguson</strong>. The two got married on November 16, 2014 and separated in 2019. She has more recently been linked to&nbsp;experimental jazz artist <strong>Gio Escobar</strong>.</p><h2>Julez dad is a former NFL player and works for Jay-Z.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Julez’ father Daniel was an NFL star back in the day, playing for the Carolina Panthers. He then became a talent manager for Jay-Z, which makes the family dynamic quite cozy, as the famous rapper is also Julez’ uncle. Daniel has remarried since his divorce to Solange and has two more children.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Daniel often gushes about his son Julez on social media, sharing adorable father/son photos of the pair. For Julez’ 14th birthday, his pops posted a picture of them with their arms around each other and the caption, “Can’t believe u are 14 years old today SON,I remember when u was just a pup, now look at you growing into your own man!!!!!! So proud of who u are my lil g, lil smitty, my lil woodie, one third of my heart, the reason I know what TRUE LOVE looks like.”</p><h2>Julez shut down rumors he was going to become a father this year.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>In April, rumors flew that Daniel was to become a father after a woman who goes by the name <strong>Adore</strong> reportedly shared texts between the pair in a since-deleted Instagram post about them being pregnant. “We both wanted it and he never told me to get a plan B,” said one alleged message from Adore, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>BCK</a>, with another reading, “We planned what we were going to do. Nobody trapped nbdy. This was literally planned.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Daniel took to his Instagram at the time to shoot down the rumors by sharing a text allegedly from Adore that said,”“Julezzzzz, tell them it’s fakeee. Pleaseeeee.” Daniel wrote to his fans, “This text was from today, she wants y’all to know it’s fake.” And in a text overlay, he added, ”&nbsp;“Now usually I wouldn’t speak on this typa stuff but this time I’m not gonna let y’all drag my family for something that’s [fabricated].”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9Koo5qml5p6tLvNZmtwb2Nrf3F7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./bob-menendez.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fame | Bob Menendez net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024">&larr;
