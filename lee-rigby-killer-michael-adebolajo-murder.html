They were both shot and injured.</p><p>A friend later said Adebolajo, then 28, had complained of being repeatedly quizzed by MI5 and turned down an offer to spy for them.</p><p><a href=#>Michael Adebowale</a>, then 22, was said to have been heavily influenced by the more forceful Adebolajo and was also said to have studied at the University of Greenwich.</p><p>In December 2013 both men were found guilty of murder.</p><p>Adebolajo was given a whole-life tariff.</p><p>Adebowale was jailed for a minimum of 45 years.</p><h2>Has he ever apologised for his savage crime?</h2><p><a href=#>The killer finally admitted his guilt and expressed "regret"</a> in a bombshell jail confession in June 2018, adding that he plans to write a letter of apology to the soldier's family.</p><p>Sources say his U-turn was "astonishing", saying the killer finally acknowledged that he had taken an innocent life.</p><p>Adebolajo expressed his new-found remorse to prison staff and a fellow inmate.</p><p>The jihadi, who cited the Quran moments after the 2013 atrocity, has also admitted he “misinterpreted” Islam’s holy book.</p><p>In a further desperate shift from his radical ways, he has asked to be known as Michael after years of insisting he be called Mujahid Abu Hamza.</p><p>The former Christian told prisoners he now rejects his extremist views and admits to being&nbsp;“brainwashed”.</p><p>He added that his attack on <a href=#>Rigby</a> was “a misguided attack on an institution”.</p><h2>Where is Michael Adebolajo now?</h2><p>Adebolajo was given a whole life order in 2014 for the brutal slaying of Rigby.</p><p>After his sentencing, it was reported that Adebolajo looked at the press in court and kissed his Quran while being escorted to prison.</p><p>Adebolajo is now serving his sentence at HMP Woodhill, near Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire.</p><p>He has since declared his actions on that fateful day of being “misinterpreted” due to brainwashing from the Quran.</p><p>Both Adebolajo and Adebowale have attempted to reduce their sentences, however this was rejected by the courts</p><p>In 2022, <a href=#>Adebolajo was banned from attending yoga classes</a> in prison due to fears he might spread extremism among inmates.</p><p>He admitted to being “gutted” by the ban as he hoped the sessions could help “improve his mental health”.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfaIV5gJVxbGiklZp6s7XGm7Bmo5mhuaa%2BjKagnKCRmrlurcOemaikkZ%2B8brnUq5ueql8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-happened-to-park-so-dam.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'Parasite' Star Park So-dam's Representation Just Shared Her Saddening Health Diagnosis With Fans">&larr;
