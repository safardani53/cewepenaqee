The same thing happened again in 2015.</p><p>For the next two years, Zoe spent most of her days <a href=#>bed-bound</a> and eventually had to give up her job as a carer as the pain became too much.</p><p>In 2018, her condition took a turn for the worse and Zoe was rushed into theatre for the aforementioned internal medical check, where she woke up with her vital reproductive organs missing.</p><p>Speaking about the ordeal, she claims: "I didn't expect to have any of my body removed that day but the doctors said they had no choice due to the severity of my condition.</p><p>"I was so upset and angry – even more so at the fact I’d been told there was no chance [the endometriosis] could be back as I’d had surgery to remove it.</p><p>"But each time I went back for surgery, it had come back worse and worse.</p><p>"I felt broken – and I still am now –&nbsp;but I thought I had to just get on with it."</p><p>Now, she's sharing her experience in a bid to raise awareness for other women, saying the situation has "broken her heart."</p><p>"Some days, I feel like a failure – I'm a woman who can't do the one thing women are meant to do, which is carrying a baby," Zoe, from Manchester, told&nbsp;http://NeedToKnow.co.uk&nbsp;.</p><p>"It breaks my heart.</p><p>"It affected me so badly, that I lost four stone in weight and I became severely depressed, as well as suffering from anxiety.</p><p>"All my life I’d wanted to be a mum and to be told this wouldn’t be possible broke me.</p><p>"It's made me question my relationships as to why someone would want to be with someone who can't have children.</p><p>"I've had all sorts of horrible thoughts that went through my head.</p><p>"Now, I resent everyone around me who are pregnant or have just had a baby."</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">What are the symtoms of endometriosis?</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Some common symptoms of endometriosis are:</p><ul><li>pain in your lower tummy or back&nbsp;(pelvic pain)&nbsp;– usually worse during your period</li><li>period pain&nbsp;that stops you doing your normal activities</li><li>pain during or after sex</li><li>pain when peeing or pooing during your period</li><li>feeling sick, constipation, diarrhoea, or blood in your pee or poo during your period</li><li>difficulty getting pregnant</li></ul><p>Source:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NHS England</a></p><p>Sadly, Zoe's battle was far from over, as in 2019, after another routine check, she woke up to find her <a href=#>bowel</a> had been removed and a <a href=#>stoma</a> bag had been fitted.</p><p><a href=# aria-label="According to the NHS (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to the NHS</a>, treatment for endometriosis that's around or inside the bowel may involve removing a section of it -
