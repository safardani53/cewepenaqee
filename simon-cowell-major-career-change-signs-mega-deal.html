seat.</p><p>The Hips Don’t Lie singer looks as stylish as ever sprawled out in leather trousers and a denim crop-top.</p><p>With oversized black shades and massive studded platform heels Shakira poses away in the back of her car.</p><p>The singer was at the <a href=#>Britsh </a>Grand Prix to cheer on her close pal <a href=#>Lewis Hamilton</a> who <a href=#>finished third</a>.</p><p>Keen to keep the party going, she hit up exclusive London restaurant and bar Chiltern Firehouse on Sunday night before sneaking out in the early hours of Monday morning.</p><p>The north London venue is known for being popular with the likes of <a href=#>Bradley Cooper</a> and <a href=#>Noel Gallagher</a>.</p><p>Bringing the F1 race to a close was chart-topper <a href=#>Tom Grennan</a>.</p><p>The Not Over Yet singer wore a bright orange outfit on stage as he ended the weekend in style.</p><p>His performance was one in a series of sets from some of the biggest names in music, as the sporting event looks to include live shows.</p><p>Everyone from<a href=#> Calvin Harris</a> to <a href=#>Cat Burns</a> and Black Eyed Peas performed over the weekend of celebrations.</p><p><a href=#>Sam Ryder</a> also played a set at the famous race track.</p><p>He said: “The crowd at Silverstone really is second to none.</p><p>“Everyone is so excited to be here and you can feel the energy from the moment you arrive.</p><p>“For

the strain of a packed summer schedule when the band performed at The Soho House Festival over the weekend.</p><p>Onlookers claimed Mutya, who was on stage at the London event with Keisha Buchanan and Siobhan Donaghy, forgot the words to their 2009 hit About You Now and stumbled through the 45-minute set on Saturday.</p><p>They said: “Sugababes have been working so hard recently and Mutya seemed to be struggling.</p><p>“She was singing About You Now and then had to admit she’d forgotten the words as she attempted to keep going.</p><p>“Her voice appeared to be strained and it was hard to watch at times, but Keisha and Siobhan supported her through it.”</p><p><a href=#>I exclusively revealed the group’s comeback</a> last summer and they played a 17-date UK tour before taking on festivals this summer.</p><p>Their next biggest gig is at London’s O2 Arena in September and they are hoping to make it a sell-out.</p><p>Plenty of time to start memorising those lyrics, Mutya.</p><img

exclusive photograph of herself in a bright dress to celebrate debut single, Nervous, which is out today.</p><p>Antigoni, who appeared on the reality show last year, told me of the catchy track: “I consider myself a confident person and I never really get nervous speaking to someone I think is attractive.</p><p>“But I was talking to this guy at a bar and actually felt nervous for once.</p><p>“I didn’t know what to say.</p><p>“That was the moment that inspired the song.”</p><p>She added: “I think people are going to relate to this song because everyone has been in a situation where they’ve felt nervous around someone they find attractive.</p><p>“It’s something that’s universal and I wanted to capture that feeling.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Adele hint at Vegas residency into 2024</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

slip her Las Vegas residency dates could be running into next year.</p><p>It is good news for those who have not yet been able to snap up tickets for her latest run in the US entertainment mecca.</p><p>While chatting to a group of New Yorkers who were drinking wine during one of her concerts, Adele was overheard saying: “You know what, I might add to merch for my next round of shows.</p><p>“One of the yard-drink beakers, that everyone can fill up at the bar.”</p><p>The British superstar’s<a href=#> postponed residency</a> ran from November last year until March, then she announced an extended set of shows from June until this November.</p><p>Insiders at <a href=#>The Colosseum at Caesars Palace</a> said they hoped Adele would pick where <a href=#>Celine Dion</a> left off, after she had a 16-year-long residency at the hotel.</p><p>They said: “Adele is proving to be a brilliant decision for the business.</p><p>“The upset of the original postponement is long forgotten, both by the executives and fans.</p><p>“Now the casino sees thousands of fans and their families flood in between Thursday and Sunday to see her, which amounts to millions being spent on rooms, services and food and beverage.</p><p>“Artists have come and gone for short runs at Caesars since Celine departed.</p><p>“But there is hope to get a long-term act and the hope is Adele fits the bill.”</p><p>The source added: “When the concert film Adele is recording is released, even more fans will want to see her shows live and we expect another spike in interest in sales.</p><p>“Adele is her own woman, so pinning her down for many years could be a lengthy negotiation.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Lana powers back</h2><img

Glastonbury set hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons after <a href=#>she rocked up late and had the power cut to her stage.</a></p><p>But the 90-minute show at BST Hyde Park in London on Sunday night went off without a hitch – with Lana apologising for her doomed Glasto set.</p><p>The singer, who has her hair done as part of her set, said: “This is where I got cut off last time. Sorry about that.”</p><p><a href=#>Lana </a>later added: “I don’t want it to end. It’s worth it. Even if you get the power cut, it’s worth it.”</p><p>I’m told a ring of steel was placed around the SummerTime Sadness singer to make sure everything ran smoothly for the sell-out concert.</p><p>A source said: “Security backstage was the tightest it’s been for the whole festival for Lana’s performance.</p><p>“No one was allowed anywhere near where Lana might be beforehand.</p><p>“The backstage crew were given strict instructions.</p><p>“It may sound extreme but it worked.</p><p>“She was only a couple of minutes late to the stage and her performance was amazing.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>A Magic night with Margot</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-windsor-england-windsor-castle-815719482.jpg><p>IT turns out that <a href=#>Margot Robbie</a> is quite a party animal.</p><p>The star of the new Barbie film took actors and actresses who play different versions of the <a href=#>Barbie </a>and Ken dolls on a secret night out in London to watch raunchy stage show Magic Mike Live.</p><p>The group even included the movie’s director Greta Gerwig.</p><p>In The latest issue of Rolling Stone UK, actor <a href=#>Ncuti Gatwa</a>, said: “One of the best nights of my life was when Margot took all the Barbies and Kens out in London to see Magic Mike Live.</p><p>“I don’t know how I made it through any filming in the week after, my voice was gone from screaming so much.</p><p>“<a href=#>Greta Gerwig</a>’s assistant was pulled up on stage and given a lap dance and Greta was screaming in delight.</p><p>&nbsp;“Margot is a very, very good party host.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Name of the game for Stefflon</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/stefflon-don-spotted-manny-nort-830864534.jpg><p><a href=#>STEFFLON DON</a> made sure no one forgot her name by wearing a diamante necklace with her moniker on it.</p><p>She wore the glittering bit of bling to the Manny Norté X Bacardi Rum bash in London’s Covent Garden, held to celebrate the end of Wireless Festival 2023.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>The rapper then completed her look with a quirky pair of shades that resembled ski goggles.</p><p>Steff danced until the early hours with a host of stars including rappers Krept And Konan, as well as Love Island stars Dami and Indiyah.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWhqY2V%2BcYOWcWasoZ2ku26vzrCcpaRdoq6ru9FmmpqqlZq%2Fbq%2FHmqWgnV2otqi60maknp%2BRYrGmrcto</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./star-wars-to-frighten-birds.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Star Wars fans wowed by Imperial AT-AT at annual scarecrow competition in Northamptonshire village">&larr;
