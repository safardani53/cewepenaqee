You’re never 100 percent after a stroke, but he’s fine. He’s aware of what’s going on.</p><p>"If he were sitting here right now, you could sit and talk to him. He’s the same old Frank.”</p><p>Frank was wheelchair-bound after suffering the stroke and even had a&nbsp;<a href=#>ramp installed outside his Iowa home</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The friend shared: “He can walk, but he’s always going to need the wheelchair because he can’t walk long distances.</p><p>“Basically, you lose motion. He lost motion. A stroke can affect your left or your right side, it affected his right side.”</p><p>The insider said Frank continues to go to outpatient therapy weekly for a few hours.&nbsp;</p><p>Frank is a “private person” and “enjoys being totally out of the limelight.”</p><p>The friend said the biggest misconception about Frank is his health.&nbsp;</p><p>The source said: “He’s had a stroke, but he’s definitely not debilitated to the point where he can’t do anything or do whatever he wants. He doesn’t have any problems with that. It’s just a change of lifestyle and it slowed him down.&nbsp;</p><p>“He’s the same old Frank. He has a good attitude and a great sense of humor. His mindset is positive. We crack jokes all the time. You gotta make the best of the situation so he’s come to terms with all of that.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>“His mind is right, he’s a happy guy and his sense of humor is there.”</p><p>He added that the conservatorship is “temporary.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/pickin-frank-american-pickers-fans-831813917.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/2021-star-american-pickers-frank-666254543.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxaGt%2FeIOXaJimnaKesKK6jKmgnKOVp8BustGapaRllqe2tcaMnKanq5Wnw6LAzqtkq6GjoHqzscyorZqkXajBs7vKnmY%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kristen-stewart-on-the-road-sex-sam-riley.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kristen Stewart On The Road Sex  Co-Star Sam Riley Says It Was Awkward  Hollywood Life">&larr;
