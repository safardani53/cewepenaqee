During the show's 13th season, this business owner vies for leading lady <a href=#>Rachel Lindsay</a>'s affection but ultimately falls short and dives straight into an emotional finale breakup (we're still drowning in a sea of tears).</p><p>After his runner-up stint on the ABC dating show, Peter decided to keep things on the down-low. But hold onto your roses because with Rachel's recent split from <a href=#>Bachelorette winner Bryan Abasolo</a>, the burning question on everyone's mind is: What's Peter doing these days? Is he dating anyone? Keep scrolling for all the known details!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is former 'Bachelorette' contestant Peter Kraus dating?</h2><p>As someone who seemingly avoids the spotlight, Peter rarely shares details about his love life. He's a pretty private individual, and with that said, it's unknown if he is dating anyone — but for now, we'll assume he's single.</p><p style=text-align:start>Despite his tight-lipped approach to his relationship status, speculation within Bachelor Nation persists regarding his romantic life. Peter was last romantically linked to fellow Bachelor star <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bibiana Julian</a> after they were spotted together at a Miami Heat basketball game in early December 2018.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Peter J Kraus (@peterkrauswi)</a></p></figure><p>Although a source told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E! News</a> the two were "casually dating," Bibiana clarified the nature of their relationship on the Dec. 17, 2018, episode of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Almost Famous</a> podcast. She said her relationship with Peter was strictly platonic — but she did hint at a brief fling (it wasn't anything serious and naturally fizzled out).</p><p>Peter briefly opened up about his love life during a January 2019 interview with the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chicago Tribune</a>.</p><p>"That wasn't even a date," he told the outlet of being spotted at the Miami Heat game. "I know Bibiana from a charity event we did together and told her I was coming down to Miami. I was like, 'Hey, I got basketball tickets, you want to go?' So, it's weird. I don't really go out on public dates anymore for that reason."</p><p style=text-align:left>Bibiana had a different recollection of events, however. In a since-deleted tweet courtesy of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly,</a> she tweeted on Jan. 25, 2019, "'Charity event' — you mean staying at my place for [four] days during the busiest week in Miami and leaving without saying goodbye or thank you?"</p><p>She then clarified that she wasn't angry at Peter; she just wanted to tell her side of the story: "To be clear, I'm not bitter just irks me when you go out of your way to be nice to someone, and they just take advantage."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Peter previously admitted he was "devastated" over his split from Rachel.</h2><p>As many of us know, Peter rarely talks about his time on The Bachelorette — he even turned down the opportunity to be the Bachelor three times! However, the gym owner once revealed he was "devastated" over his split from Rachel.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>"When I got off Rachel's season, I was devastated. It was a hard breakup," Peter told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a> in late 2017. "Going through the roller coaster of the show — with all the cliffhangers always seeming to be on me — it was an emotional toll. [Then], going on After the Final Rose and the things that happened there on set, that was hard."</p><p>He continued, "I'm an emotional guy, I'm a sensitive guy. I used to hide from that, but now I accept it and appreciate it. And that just makes me more hyperaware of the surroundings that I'm in, and The Bachelor is a big, big step I wasn't ready for.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpbK1sdFmoquZpah6o63CoZylp6KawbWxjJ2YraGenA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./chris-brown-baby-mamas.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Many Baby Mamas Does Chris Brown Have?
