He was charming and courteous, often presenting her with flowers when he picked her up from work.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>But as the months passed, Barbara gradually realised she had become isolated from her friends and family and he regularly beat her.&nbsp;</span></p><p>When she told him she wanted to end their year-long relationship, he stabbed her with a hunting knife so sharp she didn't even feel the blade go in.</p><p>Barbara survived the attack and was so terrified that Kuklinski would kill her if she left, she married him.</p><p>Unbeknown to her, by the time they were married in 1961, Kuklinski had already committed 65 murders, sometimes for fun but more often than not for money to fund his taste for expensive cars and designer clothes.</p><p><span>In 1972, Kuklinski was offered </span><span>$10,000 (about £100,000 in today's money) to kill a man - and double if he made him suffer.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000503016444-e1562256822177.jpg><p><span>The financial incentive pushed him to a new level of twisted creativity.</span></p><p><span>He flagged his victim down at a stop sign and put a gun to his head before bundling him into the trunk of his car.</span></p><p><span>Kuklinski took the man to a cave in Pennsylvania where he rigged up camera equipment and left him to be eaten alive by rats.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Four days later he returned to find disjointed bones of the man and a camera reel documenting his slow and painful death.</span></p><p><span>On another occasion Kuklinski shot his victim in his Adam's apple after making a bet about how long it would take for him to die.</span></p><p><span>It took a few minutes for him to drown in his own blood, longer than the killer had predicted - leaving him £40 out of pocket.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Christin.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000018994802.jpg><h2>I wanted to kill my father to protect my mother</h2><p>Kuklinski's violent nature continued at home.</p><p>His family didn't know about his murderous behaviour but he frequently held his wife around the neck, throttling her in front of the children.</p><p><span>With nowhere to go, Kuklinski's youngest daughter Christin came up with a plan.</span></p><p><span>“My mother and I would talk about how we could kill my father because it was the only way we could possibly be safe," she says on the documentary.</span></p><p><span>“It would have to be a guarantee because we would never have a second chance.”</span></p><p><span>Christin and her mother conjured up a plan to drug his meatloaf with Valium b</span><span>ut they became too terrified to put their plan into action.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“He would hit himself in the head so hard you could see the blood vessels popping," Christin said when describing his rage.</span></p><p><span>“We had no hope in being saved because the police had been tracking him for so long and they couldn’t get him on anything. So how were we supposed to stop him."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>His eldest daughter, Merrick, had an unbreakable bond with her father, in spite of his violent behaviour.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Merrick.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000503015045.jpg><p>After many failed undercover police attempts to catch Kuklinski, he<span> was finally arrested in 1986.
