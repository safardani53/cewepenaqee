Lock’s final episode, shot before his death, was televised by the 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown crew. </span><span>The program closed with a homage to the comic, with a pre-credits message that stated,</span></p><p><span>“In loving memory of comedic icon Sean Lock, 1963 – 2021.”</span></p><p><span>Following the incident, several admirers became distraught, while a few others were discovered discussing Lock’s weight loss – just before he died. </span><span>Fans claimed that the legendary comedian’s poor health was evident because he had lost visible weight in recent years.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/0_Sean-Lock-death.jpg><h2>Sean Lock’s Illness and Weight Loss Are Being Discussed by Fans</h2><p><span>First and foremost, Lock was diagnosed with lung cancer a long time ago, but he opted not to expose it to the world and fought it in secret.</span></p><p><span>He continues to work, most notably as a regular on the British comedic panel show 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown. Along with fellow comic Jon Richardson, he was one of the two regular team captains.</span></p><p><span>So, a few months after Lock’s death, a YouTube user uploaded a video to the platform that included a compilation of Lock’s final appearances on 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown.</span></p><p><span>A viewer left a comment on the video.</span></p><p><span>“Sean is a wuss. He was clearly ill here, but he carried on like the intelligent man he was. It’s a shame he’s gone “</span></p><p><span>Another person stated,</span></p><p><span>“There’s a man who is plainly unwell and can’t be feeling well, but he keeps making other people laugh and bringing joy to the world till the end. He can teach us all a thing or two.”</span></p><h2>Weight Loss and an Unknown Cancer Battle</h2><p><span>Lock’s admirers, like the latter, were completely unaware of the comedian’s secret cancer fight.</span></p><p><span>However, his weight loss pointed to his poor health, causing admirers to worry about him for an extended period. </span><span>Before his weight reduction and cancer struggle, he was a very charming comic who frequently wore his smile along with his rectangular black-framed glasses.</span></p><p><span>Lock, with his amusing faces and stage motions, was also highly dynamic on stage. </span><span>But the awful news had to come out eventually, and when it did, it devastated many hearts. </span><span>Bill Bailey, a fellow comic, was one of the first to inform the world about his death and disease in August 2021.</span></p><p><span>During an interview, he revealed that Lock continued to work despite his illness, which enabled him to leave his family a fortune worth more than $4 million.</span></p><p><span>Bailey stated.</span></p><p><span>“He’s an incredibly brave and difficult man who remained mentally strong throughout the entire ordeal. I’m just thankful for the time we’ve spent together “</span></p><p><span>The Lock is survived by his wife, Anoushka Nara Giltsoff, and their three children.</span></p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiqnpmeYrmwr8qsZLCdmZy1tXnLqKqsZaeWwG6tjKygoKZdpLNutMisZK6mm6O8uLqMnJinm5WneqOt062jnmc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./razyzzxuprlceol8epkok1ewmy7w1oz.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Watch 48 Hours Season 25 Episode 52: Long Island Serial Killer">&larr;
