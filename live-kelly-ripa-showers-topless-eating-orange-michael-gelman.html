You need another session."</p><p>After Michael, Mark, and the audience started laughing, Kelly claimed: "This is, I believe, gaslighting. I'm getting gaslit."</p><h2>HOST WITH THE MOST?</h2><p>On Thursday, Mark was joined by the couple's good friend,&nbsp;<a href=#>Anderson Cooper</a>, 56, and he shared a sweet&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>&nbsp;video of their greeting backstage.</p><p>In the clip, the&nbsp;<a href=#>Riverdale</a>&nbsp;actor snuck up on Anderson in his&nbsp;dressing room&nbsp;with a big smile on his face.</p><p>When the CNN broadcaster noticed his friend at the door, he, in turn, beamed with joy as the pair embraced with a hug.</p><p>For his caption, he wrote: "Co-hosting with the silver fox."</p><p>Fans raced to the comment section to applaud the pair for their co-hosting duties, warning Kelly that&nbsp;<a href=#>Anderson could steal her day job</a>.</p><p>One person gushed: "OH MY GOSH!!!! You two were hilarious together!!!! Absolutely LOVED the show!!!!"</p><p>Another critiqued: "Anderson was so funny without trying to be funny! Mark was really laughing, great show today."</p><p>A third wrote: "@instasuelos nothing can compete with you co-hosting with the Silver Fox. Great job you guys were so funny."</p><p>And a fourth raved: "LOVED you two together!! Great show!!!" while a final noted: "Amazing pair!!! Loved the show! Watch out Kelly."</p><h2>GOODBYE FOR NOW!</h2><p>This week, The U.S Sun exclusively learned that&nbsp;<a href=#>Live was taking a break</a>&nbsp;from filming until the fall.</p><p>Ahead of making a splash with their new show opener, Kelly, Mark, and the show's crew will be able to enjoy the rest of their <a href=#>summer</a> away from the set.</p><p>The group will reunite to film new episodes on September 5; the same time last year&nbsp;that&nbsp;<a href=#>Live with Kelly and Ryan</a>&nbsp;- with ex-host&nbsp;<a href=#>Ryan Seacrest</a>, 48 -&nbsp;<a href=#>premiered its new season</a>.</p><p>A source close to production told The U.S. Sun: "The Live&nbsp;family&nbsp;is taking their annual summer break, but will still be providing fresh new material to viewers at home during this time."</p><p>The insider added that even though there is no filming happening over the&nbsp;next&nbsp;few weeks, there are still some staffers hard at work planning Halloween content.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Despite&nbsp;the talk&nbsp;show being on hiatus from filming, the&nbsp;<a href=#>pre-taped episodes</a>&nbsp;that will air include new content that production and hosts "worked so hard on."</p><p>"Kelly and Mark's goal is to just bring joy and a bunch of laughter and smiles all summer long," the source shared.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/nk_WhatTheKell_Live_9JPG-JS835518677.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/nk_WhatTheKell_Live_10JPG-JS835518683.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/nk_WhatTheKell_Live_11JPG-JS835518684.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwZ2l%2BeIGSaKOirpViuKa4y7Jkq6Gglnq0tM6wnKurXam8sbjErKpmnZGptq%2BzjKipmqaXmnqutcKhmJ6kXZyyrbnAp2Y%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./noah-beck-nailea-devora-dating-rumors.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Noah Beck And Nailea Devora's Dating Rumors Explained">&larr;
