That man will put a doll in almost anything — and just when you think there isn't a doll, that's when a doll shows up. Sometimes the doll is less obvious, but at the end of the day we feel safe in asserting that <a href=#>James Wan</a> fully understands the inherent unsettling creepiness that comes with dolls.</p><p>In Wan's film <a href=#>M3GAN</a>, James applies a modern twist to his doll obsession and it's just as horrifying as all the others. The movie has a somewhat familiar cast, but the titular role went to a relatively new actress. Amie Donald brings M3GAN to life in the movie while audiences will most assuredly wish for her demise. Let's get to know Amie and explore the other projects she's starred in.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who voices the doll in 'M3GAN'? It wasn't Amie.</h2><p>Amie Donald may have helped bring M3GAN to life, but she didn't voice the doll — Jenna Davis did. In terms of Amie's role, she was tasked with moving M3GAN's body, and was able to do this by wearing an animatronics mask. Therefore, M3GAN's character was made possible with CGI, a child actor, and a little puppeteering.</p><p>Now that you know a little bit more about Amie's role in M3GAN, let's get to know more about who the child star is.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Amie was born around 2010–2011 and hails from New Zealand where, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her Instagram</a>, she's already a fairly accomplished professional dancer.</p><p>In May 2022, the adorably named Bubblegum Talent Agency congratulated its client via a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>very sweet Facebook post</strong></a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"We are absolutely thrilled to finally announce that our amazing AMIE DONALD was cast as a lead role in the American horror film M3GAN," they excitedly wrote.</p><p>Apparently, Amie was able to complete the movie right before <a href=#>Auckland</a> entered another lockdown in August 2021. It's clear she was cast for this part due to her incredible roster of skills, which is impressive at such a young age.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"As her debut into international movie roles, the multi-talented youngster utilized not only her acting skills but had the opportunity to use her extensive dance training AND performed her own stunts," the talent agency's post continued.</p><p>Her own stunts? We are now feeling very intimidated.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is 'M3GAN' about and why was the film such a success?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>As <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a> succinctly describes it, M3GAN is an "AI, childlike robot doll who has a murderous taste for blood." Perfect, sign us up. It also stars <a href=#>Allison Willams</a> (<a href=#>Get Out</a>) as "Gemma, a toy company roboticist who programs the artificial intelligence doll." This is the James Wan doll interest being thrust into a world of technology. It's quite the leap from 2007's Dead Silence, which focused on a ventriloquist dummy, both wooden and human.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Gemma's intentions are pure, building M3GAN as a companion for her niece Cady (Violet McGraw) who recently lost both parents in a tragic car crash. Of course, the best laid plans can also end up like Annabelle (2014), a vintage porcelain doll meant to be a gift for a newborn baby but oops, this doll is possessed. Aren't they always?</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>M3GAN's protective setting goes from supportive to violent when Cady is bullied by a schoolmate. The trailer dropped in October 2022 and showcased Amie as M3GAN dancing as if no one is watching. However, the dancing took on a sinister tone as it was clearly followed by murder.</p><p>After M3GAN released in theaters on Friday, Jan. 6, 2023, the film raked in $45 million during opening weekend, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>. And because the show delivered a perfect blend of horror and comedy, fans gave it <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stellar ratings</a>, making it a surprise success no one really was expecting. While some say they enjoyed the special effects, others credited the plot flow and it not being "exceptionally scary" as their reasoning for giving it a positive review.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What movies does Amie Donald play in?</h2><p>If you already streamed <a href=#><strong>Sweet Tooth</strong></a>, a post-apocalyptic series about hybrid babies (born part animal, part human) that coincidentally arrive the same time a deadly virus sprouts up and slowly destroys humanity, you may have spotted Amie amidst the "crowd" of hybrid kids.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In <a href=#><strong>Season 3</strong></a> of Sweet Tooth, Amie plays Maya Monkey, the hybrid who doesn't speak but instead relies on sign language to communicate. If you haven't watched the series, you're missing out!</p><p>In addition to M3GAN and Sweet Tooth, Amie also played the role of a stunt double in The Tank (2023). M3GAN 2.0 was also confirmed, so we may see her reprise her role as the evil doll we wish we never met.</p><p>Given the large roles Amie has already secured, it's clear she bright future ahead of her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrqqsYydpqeZnJl6rn%2FGmqVmpZ%2BrtqY%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./parnelli-jones-19330812-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Parnelli Jones (Race Car Driver) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More">&larr;
