The last time was back in the early 1980s when I was in college,” Petersen told <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Yakima Herald.</a> “The inflation now is causing all the discretionary income to go to shelter, food and fuel. And I deal with discretionary income.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><p>“So my plan is to try to have a soft landing instead of a crash landing,” he added. “That’s one of the factors that are going into my decision.”</p><h2>A LONGSTANDING LEGACY</h2><p>Petersen originally took over the furniture business from his parents Howard and Joyce Roy, who established the shop in 1969.</p><p>Changing three locations over the years, the store quickly became a main fixture in the community, supplying the furniture for any room or occasion.</p><p>Over the years, H&H Furniture even tested out a furniture rental program, which expanded across several cities in the state.</p><p>H&H Furniture was set to close in the 1980s, but once Petersen joined his parents in the business, he started to envision a pathway forward for the brand and its rental program.</p><p>“I was just supposedly here to help close it out, but I saw the potential of the rental business,” Petersen said. “That ended up taking over most of the business over the years.”</p><p>Furniture stores, like a majority of retailers, have been acquired and dominated by national chains, leaving many mom-and-pops out in the dust.</p><p>In recent years, the situation has been exacerbated by the pandemic, which opened many shoppers’ eyes to the pros of online shopping.</p><p>This has escalated the precarious financial situation brick-and-mortars already found themselves in.</p><p>“The internet has without a doubt changed things,” Petersen said. “And I think what accelerated its impact, also beyond a doubt, was COVID, where people couldn’t come out.”</p><p>As H&H begins its liquidation sales, Petersen anticipates all furniture will be gone by early June.</p><p>TVs, appliances, and bed and mattress sets are likely some of the best deals you can claim.</p><p>But H&H Furniture also said shoppers should expect some massive savings on dressers, washers and dryers.</p><h2>RETAIL APOCALYPSE</h2><p>Both independent stores and retail giants alike are experiencing financial difficulties coming out of the <a href=#>pandemic</a>.</p><p>Over the next three years, <a href=#>Macy’s</a> announced it will close a total of 125 locations.</p><p>That will mean nearly a fifth of their U.S. stores will be gone by the end of 2023.</p><p>At the beginning of 2020, there were 777 Macy's and <a href=#>Bloomingdale's</a> storefronts still in existence. But now, the company has its eye on just 650 stores across the US.</p><p>Even <a href=#>Walmart</a> has been forced to close its low-performing storefronts.</p><p><a href=#>Four new closures</a> were announced in <a href=#>Chicago</a>, leaving many shoppers with one less place to find affordable groceries.</p><p>"The simplest explanation is that collectively our Chicago stores have not been profitable since we opened the first one nearly 17 years ago," Walmart said in a statement.</p><p>But that’s just the tip of the iceberg as Walmart looks to get rid of more even more stores this month, all of which couldn’t keep up with financial expectations.</p><p>An Everett, <a href=#>Washington</a> Walmart will shutter on April 21 alongside locations in South Bend, <a href=#>Indiana</a>, Brooklyn Center, <a href=#>Minnesota</a>, and Honolulu, <a href=#>Hawaii</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>An iconic jewelry store and beloved family business is also shutting down <a href=#>in Arkansas.</a></p><p>And another mom and pop had to say goodbye to customers <a href=#>in Iowa</a> after 42 years in business.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zKilnrFfbIV5gpdub2iepae7qsDUq5xmq6Skv6Z5wqWmrK2imnq4rdKhoKefpKS7cA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ned-fulmer-wife.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meet 'No-Recipe Road Trip With the Try Guys' Star Ned Fulmer's Girlboss Wife">&larr;
