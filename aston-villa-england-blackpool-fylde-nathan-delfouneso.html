where he suffered a heartbreaking defeat in the final against the host nation.</p><p>Delfouneso made his senior debut for Villa as a sub away to FH Hafnarfjordur in the Uefa Cup in August 2018 - making him the youngest player to represent the club in European competition, at the age of 17 years and 195 days.&nbsp;</p><p>Weeks later he burst onto the big time after being handed his first start as he scored a brilliant left-foot volley against MSK Zilina in the same competition.</p><p>That was followed up later in Europe with a consolation goal away at Hamburger SV on his second start and then he found the net in an FA Cup fourth round replay against Doncaster Rovers.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Football</h2></p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong><a href=#>CASINO SPECIAL - BEST ONLINE CASINOS FOR 2023</a></strong></p><p>A Premier League debut, as substitute against Tottenham, was just reward for his progress and he was voted both Villa's Players' Young Player of the Year and Supporters' Young Player of the Year.</p><p>Delfouneso penned a new long-term deal and was celebrating his first <a href=#>Premier League</a> goal, which came against Portsmouth, the following season.</p><p>Then, after injuries to Gabriel Agbonlahor, Emile Heskey and John Carew, he got his first top-flight start on November 6 2010 and just four days later grabbed his second Premier League goal in a 3–2 win against Blackpool.</p><p>However, things began to take a downward turn as he was sent out on loan five times.</p><p>The first was at <a href=#>Championship</a> club Burnley, where he scored once in 11 outings, followed by a brief four game and goalless stint with Leicester.</p><p>A season-long loan spell at Blackpool led to six goals in 41 matches during the 2012/13 campaign, leading to him re-joining the Tangerines the following year, but he returned to Villa without scoring in his eight outings.</p><p>He finished the 2013/14 season with Coventry City but fitness issues led to him finding the net only twice and that summer he found himself a free agent following his release by Villa.</p><p>That led to a return to Blackpool, but his three goals that season failed to convince them to extend his one-year deal and he soon found himself at <a href=#>Blackburn</a>.</p><p>Delfouneso scored once in the Championship but was sent out to Bury on loan, in which he failed to score in four appearances, before heading to Swindon Town on a free.</p><p>The 2016/17 campaign only produced one goal for the striker and at the end of it he returned to the familiar settings of Blackpool - which led to a three-year spell at Bloomfield Road.</p><p>He helped them to win the League One play-offs in 2017 and scored a total of 24 goals for them before joining Bolton Wanderers in 2020.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/15-8-15-nathan-delfouneso-182912281.jpg><p>His two years with the Trotters, which also included a short loan spell with Bradford City, only produced six league goals and he found himself a free agent again in the summer of 2022.</p><p>Delfouneso penned a six-month deal with Accrington Stanley at the start of this season, but after just six appearances and no goals, he left them in January.</p><p>But it was not long before another club came knocking, only this time it was outside of the Football League.</p><p>After Delfouneso signed on the dotted line for AFC Fylde last week, the Coasters’ director of football Chris Beech said: “Like most things in life, while negotiations take place, they need financing, and at this point, I would like to thank the chairman for recognising the need and supporting the process.</p><p>“Nathan joins us at a pivotal part of the season to support our attacking threat moving into the last quarter of the season.</p><p>“With Nathan’s football intelligence, experience and technique, he will add to our squad dynamic and support the team in the last 11 games of the season, with our imminent challenges and opportunities in front of us.”</p><p>Delfouneso, who wears the No.11 shirt, added: “I’m happy to be here, and I hope I can help the club push on in the final 11 games and achieve the main goal of promotion at the end of the season.”</p><p>And he has certainly played his part so far after securing what could be a vital three points for the National League table-toppers with his headed matchwinner on Saturday.</p><p>And after his heroic debut, he told <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">the club's website</a>: “I’m happy to help, score and contribute to the team getting the three points.&nbsp;</p><p>“I knew a few people here, players and staff, and I thank them for being very welcoming and they’ve looked after me very well.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“I want to enjoy football and I’m here to contribute and help this team try and achieve their goals, which is obviously to go up.”</p><p>AFC Fylde are currently five points clear at the top with two games in hand on second-placed King’s Lynn Town following Tuesday’s victory.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/b22e0218-cbf4-42f5-96c3-f6cf6e52fc76.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH9yg5hubWlqX5bAtbvNZq2ipJyWeqa6xqWYp5xdl7mir8qppqikXZvGrbDEZqWarJiWu26wxKWdqK2emsCwew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./40-record-producer.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fame | 40 (record producer) net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024">&larr;
