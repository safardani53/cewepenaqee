If there is something dodgy I don't want to get shafted.</p><p>"We went to the gig and everything was fine. Everyone else was coming out and collecting their cars."</p><p>Tom went home and thought nothing of the matter, until last Thursday when he received a £70 parking fine from Trafford Council.</p><p>The letter said he had parked on double yellow lines illegally and had failed to pay the reduced amount in the 14-day grace period.</p><p>Tom said: "A letter came through from Trafford Council with the parking charge and the exact time and date from the gig.</p><p>"They said we had ignored the first notice and had 14 days to pay the full amount.</p><p>"But I hadn't received a letter which makes me think the parking person from the council has come along and put tickets on the cars and the men have removed them to remove any suspicion.</p><p>"We have contested the fine online but haven’t heard anything back yet."</p><h2>'SCAM' REPORTED TO COPS</h2><p>Tom said he has since reported the incident to Greater Manchester Police and has been issued with a crime reference number.</p><p>He said it had "angered him" and he believes the men involved will have made a few hundred pounds from the evening.</p><p>Tom said: "It was quite a long road and there were lots of other cars parking there too - maybe around 100.</p><p>"They were wearing high-visibility jackets but they didn't say anything on them.</p><p>"It's angered me so much."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Latest Scams and fraud news</h2></p><p>A spokesperson for Trafford Council said: "The Council did carry out parking enforcement action on Pomona Strand on this date concerning vehicles parked on double yellow lines.</p><p>"We will respond to appeals once they have been reviewed and will re-offer the discounted payment amount where necessary.</p><p>"It is illegal for anyone to take cash for parking on a public highway and the Council would advise anyone who writes in to report this to Greater Manchester Police."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>In a further statement, the spokesperson added: "The Council has received emails that refer to people being asked to pay cash to park on the public highway.</p><p>"This is a matter for Greater Manchester Police and should be reported to GMP."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000694590093.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000694590009.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000694590015.jpg><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The Sun news desk?</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Exhausted shopper forced to climb up and down four storeys laden with bags of Christmas presents as carpark door blocked</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqamraeiqHxygpZxanJpZ2Sxs7XVnqmsZZaeu6awjKyamqVdpa6zt8innmaZpKmyr7DAp6usZZ2Wu6S0xKyrnqpf</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kieron-conway.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fame | Kieron Conway net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024">&larr;
