You're ready to barbeque.</li><h2>How much do lighters for BBQs cost?</h2><p>You don't have to fork out a fortune for barbecue lighters, with plenty of low-cost budget buys available alongside some more premium options.</p><p>If you are shopping on a budget you can pick up a refillable lighter for as little as £3.99, like the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Kitchen Craft Butane Gas Lighter</a> from Nisbits, which makes for the perfect budget lighter that will still see you through multiple barbecues.</p><p>Or if your budget can stretch to it, you can opt for the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Looftlighter Hot Air Lighter</a> from Lakeland at a premium of £74.99 which uses hot air instead of a flame to ignite your barbecues but will last you a lifetime without needing to be refilled.</p><h2>How to refill a BBQ lighter</h2><p>If you have a butane gas lighter there will come a time when you need to refill it, as with any gas lighter - but it is a lot easier than you may think.</p><p>Here is a quick step-by-step guide:</p><li>First, either remove the bottom of the lighter or locate the pinhole at the base of your model.</li><li>Then insert the pin of the lighter gas refill canister into the hole at the bottom of the lighter.</li><li>Hold it for just 3 seconds to fill the lighter and remove it.</li><li>It's always best to wait 2 minutes after refilling before you start using your lighter.</li><li>Hey presto! You're all set.</li><h2>How does a BBQ lighter work?</h2><p>How your particular barbeque lighter will work depends on the model you have purchased, and as we have found in our hunt for the best on the market, there are more options than you might think.</p><p>Your average lighter, and the more traditional pick, will work using butane gas and an adjustable flame - but these require refilling and will eventually run out.</p><p>But now you can also find more long-term solutions like rechargeable devices, such as models that use an electric current to ignite your barbeque fires or even hot air devices that reach up to 600C to get things cooking.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqysp2Wjmrmmr9OsZmptYm6AdnyPaJmeq6Rir6O9jKWgoKCkmr9w</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ethan-fineshriber.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ethan Fineshriber">&larr;
