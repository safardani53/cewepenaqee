It can be found in the pyramids of Egypt, facial aesthetics and even the shape of the breast.</p><p>"There’s been various studies that define the most attractive breast shape taking into account the ratio of the upper to lower pole of the breast with the level of the nipple marked the dividing line between the upper and lower poles.</p><p>"The ratios include 35:65, 45:55, 50:50, and 55:45. One breast ratio which is mostly discussed in the media is 45:55."</p><h2>Denise Richards - 45:55</h2><p>Former <a href=#>Real Housewife Of Beverly Hills</a> star Denise has scientifically ‘perfect’ breasts, according to the ratio.</p><p>Mr Allen Rezai MD said: "The size of Denise’s breasts fit perfectly with the proportion of her body and shape.</p><p>"Her upper breast tissue appears to be full and supple, which gives a natural look. Providing a natural slope in the upper pole with fullness in the lower pole."</p><p>He added that it’s all about the ‘natural look’ when it comes to breasts; he said "has she, or hasn’t she" is the question a lot of his patients want from surgery - for people not being able to tell if they’ve had breast implants.</p><h2>Michelle Keegan- 45:55</h2><p>Actress Michelle's breasts are also scientifically ‘perfect’ - with a 45:55 Golden Ratio equation.</p><p>Mr Rezai explained that Michelle's ratio "provides a natural breast appearance".</p><p>"It is in proportion to her slim and petite figure," he added.</p><h2>Miranda Kerr - 55:45</h2><p>The ex <a href=#>Victoria’s Secret </a>supermodel also featured in the top five list.</p><p>Mr Rezai believes the most attractive breast size and shape is one that complements a person’s figure, rather than under- or overwhelms it.</p><p>He said this has a lot to do with proportion and Miranda’s breasts perfectly complement her body shape, including her hip to waist ratio and height.</p><p>He added: "The tissue appears to be soft, and distributed evenly. They appear full but not overly large - they just sit very well with her proportions."</p><h2>Holly Willoughby - 55:45</h2><p>TV star Holly Willoughby was also listed in Mr Rezai’s compilation as her breasts are in proportion to her figure.</p><p>The surgeon added: "Holly’s breasts are in proportion to her toned figure, with a ratio of 55:45.</p><p>"It appears she has a slightly longer upper breast pole compared to the distance from nipple to breast fold."</p><h2>Amanda Holden - 60:40</h2><p>The <a href=#>Britain’s Got Talent</a> judge also appeared in the list - with her breasts given a 60:40 ratio based on the formula.</p><p>Mr Rezai said: "Amanda Holden’s breast ratio is 60:40 with a longer upper breast pole compared to the distance between nipple to breast fold.</p><p>"If she were to have more volume, her breasts would look out of proportion, unless the distance between nipple and breast fold are increased."</p><p>Mr Rezai believes a ‘Natural Look’ Breast Augmentation can achieve the Golden Ratio.</p><p>But similar to shoe sizing, he says a bespoke treatment plan is vital in achieving natural results, the perfect fit or the Golden Ratio.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">What is the golden ratio and how to work it out?</h3></p><ul><li>The Golden Ratio is the numerical definition of ‘perfect’ beauty which dates back over 2500 years as a ratio of 1:1.618, known as ‘phi’.</li><li>The mathematical equation sees the ideal breast proportion as 45:55 where 45 percent of the breast would be above the nipple and 55 percent below the nipple.</li><li>Dr Patrick Mallucci identified the formula for perfect breasts in 2007 after conducting a study where people ranked breast types with different proportions.&nbsp;</li><li>The poll found that 87 per cent of respondents ranked breasts of the 45:55 ratio as their favourites.</li><li>The Upper Pole was either straight or concave, and the nipple was pointing skywards at an average angle of 20 degrees.&nbsp;</li><li>In all cases the breasts demonstrated a tight convex lower pole – a neat but voluminous curve.</li><li>The ratio can be found by measuring the percentage of the breast above and below the nipple.</li></ul><p>He said: "There is no set method in achieving natural-looking results, Instead treatment plans should be tailored for each patient as every individual is different in terms of anatomy, lifestyle and preference.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"With a “Natural Look” and the Golden Ratio in mind, I consider patient’s height, weight, breast width, breast height and the distance that exists between the nipple and breast fold, as well as patient’s preference in terms of upper and lower breast pole volume to determine the best breast implant type and size for the patient’s body, as well as the best surgical techniques to employ.</p><p>However, beauty is in the eyes of the beholder and it is not ideal to define beautiful and natural breasts 100 per cent based on one ratio."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5BsaXJtZGeAcLnInJ%2BepJyaeqyxxKCYp2WSmsC1ecGrnJqrpKh6uLvRpZtmn5%2Bhsaa6jKuYraGfZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./chad-overhauser.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chad Overhauser">&larr;
