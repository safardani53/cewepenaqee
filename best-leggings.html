Paired with a smart-looking top, of course.</p><p>Loungewear is undeniably having a moment, with leggings at the forefront thanks to their flexible stretch, versatility and flattering, streamlined silhouette.</p><p>It's the piece of clothing that joins gym bunnies, TV marathon lovers, and everyone else who prefers something comfy and practical to walk their dog in: they're such an easy go-to.</p><h2>Best leggings at a glance:</h2><ul><li><strong>Best leggings for sustainability: </strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">BAM</a></li><li><strong>Best compression leggings:</strong> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break">Proskins</span></a></li><li><strong>Best leggings for yoga: </strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">BAM</a></li><li><strong>Best period-proof leggings:</strong> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">WUKA</a></li><li><strong>Best work-from-home leggings:</strong> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Lululemon</a></li><li><strong>Best fashion leggings:</strong> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">SPANX</a></li><li><strong>Best flared leggings:</strong> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">TALA</a></li></ul><h2>Best work-from-home leggings: <strong>Lululemon Align High-Rise 28" Leggings</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Untitled-design-11-3.png><ul><li><strong>Lululemon Align High-Rise 28" Leggings, £88 from Lululemon - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Lululemon</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Leg length:</strong> Full; <strong>Price:</strong> £88; <strong>Size range:</strong> UK 4 to 24; <strong>Colours available:</strong> 18 colours; <strong>Fabric:</strong> Nylon and lycra elastane</p><p><strong>Pros:&nbsp;</strong>Lightweight and breathable, waistband doesn't dig, but also stays put, super soft, easy to put on, comfortable, form-fitting and flattering, available in sizes UK 4 to 24, available in 18 colours&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> None</p><p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5/5</p><p>Looking for something to easily work out and work from home in?

This kind of fabric is notoriously hit and miss, sometimes hugging you in the right place and other times being incredibly unflattering.</p><p>However, Spanx has nailed it. These leggings are a mix of shapewear and leggings and are designed to not only be stylish, but to make your tummy look flatter and your bum more lifted.</p><p>These leggings slid on easily and we were surprised at how much we loved them The waistband sits at the perfect point on your waist and is contouring without being too tight and causing muffin top. We'll be wearing ours with everything from heels and a blouse to trainers and a crop top.</p><h2>Best Flared Leggings: TALA SkinLuxe High Waisted Flared Legging</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Untitled-design-13-1.png><ul><li><strong>TALA SkinLuxe High Waisted Flared Legging, £56 from TALA - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Leg length:</strong> Full; <strong>Price:</strong> £56; <strong>Size range:</strong> XS to XL; <strong>Colours available:</strong> 4 colours; <strong>Fabric:</strong> Recycled nylon and lycra</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Flattering flared leg, waistband doesn't fall down, super soft, easy to put on, comfortable, back pocket with zip, lightweight, sustainable (made from recycled nylon)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons:&nbsp;</strong>Only available in 4 colours&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5/5</p><p>TALA's SkinLuxe flared leggings have been one of our favourites for a while now. Flared jeans are so in right now, and so are flared leggings.&nbsp; Not only are they trendy, but this shape is really flattering on the waist, thighs and bum. They're great for accentuating curves without being skin-tight.</p><p>We wear this pair all the time, as they're ideal for WFH and then heading out for a walk with friends. We've also seen lots of people wear them with formal wear to the office, too.</p><p>They're also great for hardcore workouts, especially on days when you're feeling a little bloated or feel like covering up a bit more, as the high waist will not roll down.</p><h2>Best period-proof leggings: WUKA Perform Leggings</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Untitled-design-18.png><ul><li><strong>WUKA Perform Leggings, £49.99 - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">WUKA</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Material:</strong> recycled polyester, <strong>Length:</strong> 32 inches, <strong>Best for:</strong> low-intensity workouts</p><p>There's nothing worse than worrying that your leggings won't be leakproof when you're mid-flow and working out while on your period.</p><p>Or, bending into the downward dog position, worrying about how your bulky pad looks from behind...</p><p>With WUKA's Perform period-proof leggings, you can squat, shimmy, run and ride to your heart's content and forget about your pad not being enough when it comes to your next workout.</p><p>WUKA's leggings, made from recycled polyester, have integrated seamless period pants inside and can hold up to three tampons' worth (around 15ml) of blood - replacing period products altogether when it comes to keeping active. We tried them on day two of our period and can confirm that this really is the case. While we thought we'd be using these as an extra layer 'just in case' our tampon or pad failed us, we really will be using them as our main sanitary method when we're on our period. There's no need to double up.</p><p>The sustainable, lightweight fabric is super absorbent and has a moisture barrier, to wick away sweat and your period flow, as well as a comfy addition to your active lifestyle - plus, they're size inclusive too, going up to a 6XL.</p><h2>Best sustainable leggings: BAM's Enduro Deep Waistband Bamboo Leggings</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Untitled-design-15.png><ul><li><strong>BAM Enduro Bamboo Deep Waistband Leggings, £49 from BAM - <a href=#>buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Leg length:</strong> Full; <strong>Price:</strong> £49; <strong>Size range:</strong> 8-18; <strong>Colours available:</strong> 14 colours; <strong>Fabric:</strong> Bamboo, viscose, organic cotton and elastane</p><p><strong>Pros:&nbsp;</strong>Flattering, sustainable, range of colours available, don't fall down, thick waistband, discrete logo&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Tricky to get on</p><p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/5</p><p>If you're looking for quality leggings that are eco-friendly to boot, BAM has an amazing range of plain and printed styles that are ideal for yoga, sports and everyday wear — plus, BAM has just announced plans to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">reduce all of its impacts</a> (climate, waste, water, chemical, human and land use) by 2030. Nice one.</p><p>Made from bamboo, this neutral black pair is non-see-through, supportive and irresistibly comfortable. They're a little tricky to get in but they're the right balance of comfortable and figure-hugging once you do wiggle into them. Plus, the close fit means the waistband stays put while you're working out.</p><p>Bamboo works really well as a performance fabric, too (due to its sweat-wicking absorbency).</p><h2>Best compression leggings: <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break">Proskins Classic&nbsp;</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51zpcjvEd2L._AC_UX679_.jpg><ul><li><strong><span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break">Proskins Classic Slim, Anti Cellulite Slimming Compression - Full-Length Leggings, £49.99 from Amazon - </span><a href=#>buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Leg length:</strong> Full; <strong>Price:</strong> £49.99; <strong>Size range:</strong> 4-24; <strong>Colours available:</strong> 4 colours; <strong>Fabric:</strong> Unspecified</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>High compression, very flattering, ingredients that combat cellulite, moisture wicking</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5/5</p><p>We loved how supported we felt while wearing these high compression leggings from Proskins, and found it hard to switch back to regular high-waisted leggings after wearing them.</p><p>Having the waistline go right up to below the bra was super comfortable, and felt like a mix of shapewear and leggings.</p><p>The compression fabric is super flattering and gives the tummy a bit of extra firming. Plus, the fabric is infused with retinol, ceramides, aloe vera and Vitamin E to give the skin a youthful glow and prevent cellulite.</p><h2>TALA DayFlex High Waisted Legging</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Untitled-design-12-2.png><ul><li><strong>TALA DayFlex High Waisted Legging, £59 from TALA - <a href=#>buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Leg length:</strong> Full or 7/8; <strong>Price:</strong> £59; <strong>Size range:</strong> 2XS to XL; <strong>Colours available:</strong> 6 colours; <strong>Fabric:</strong> Recycled nylon and lycra</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Available in 2xs to XL, available in full length and 7/8, available in six stylish muted shades, very, very easy to put on, waistband doesn't slip, supportive on tummy, comfortable, sweetheart contouring, sustainable (made from 75% recycled nylon)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> None</p><p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5/5</p><p>TALA's DayFlex leggings are the perfect pair of black leggings.

They're silky soft and cosy but still lightweight and breathable, so you won't overheat during a workout.</p><p>We love the flattering V-shaped waistband. Firstly, it's unique and is a nice twist on a regular pair of black leggings. But also, it makes your waist smaller and your bum look more lifted.</p><h2><b>Snag 7/8 Leggings</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Snag-leggings.jpg><p><strong>Material:</strong> 69% Ecovero Viscose, 26% Recycle Polyamide, 5% Elastane, <strong>Length:</strong> 28 inches, <strong>Best for:</strong> gym sessions</p><p>We love Snag after having reviewed both its range of <a href=# rel>tights</a> and <a href=#>chub rub shorts</a> - and we're pleased to see that the brand has now ventured into size-inclusive leggings that fit, going up to a size 36/38.</p><p>Snag's sizes are arranged by letter, rather than number, and are true to size - but it's best to check out its <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">size guide</a> before you commit to buying.</p><p>We tried Snag's 7/8 leggings in black in a size E (UK 16-18), but they also come in purple, and can safely say that they are fully opaque, as well as the best pair of fitted leggings we've owned.</p><p>The tights boast a wide, high-waist band, to stop them from falling down, and feel soft to the touch - they are quite thick, too, meaning you can't see your knickers when walking or bending over.</p><p>However, these leggings are pretty warm, thanks to the thickness, so they're not one to wear in warmer months and we couldn't imagine wearing them to work out. They'd be fine for a few squats and a yoga sesh but perhaps paired with a light top.</p><p>Still, we wore them with a long jumper and jacket, as well as trainers, and found they fitted great for a long day out idling around the shops and commuting during the week.</p><p>The best part? They have pockets! Seriously. The pockets are big enough to fit your phone in, and your whole hand if you want to show off to your friends.</p><p>Our only qualm would be that the stitching around the pockets and seams was quite wide, meaning you couldn't wear them for a more formal occasion or a night out, say, but it's evidence of great craftmanship if anything.</p><p>We loved the ankle-length, meaning you can pair them with trainers or boots, and found them super comfortable.</p><p>Plus, Snag is a living wage employer and all of its products are made from recycled materials, including these leggings which are made from recycled polyamide, elastane and certified eco-responsible viscose.</p><p>You can read our full review of Snag's tights <a href=#>here</a>.</p><h2>Fabletics Define PowerHold High-Waisted 7/8 Legging</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Untitled-design-11-2.png><ul><li><strong>Fabletics Define PowerHold High-Waisted 7/8 Legging, £69 for non-members at Fabletics - <a href=#>buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Leg length:</strong> 7/8; <strong>Price:</strong> £69; <strong>Size range:</strong> XXS to 4X; <strong>Colours available:</strong> 33 colours; <strong>Fabric:</strong> Polyester and elastane</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong>33 different colour options, high compression, very flattering, sweat-wicking, chafe-resistant, UPF protection, pockets&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Unlike the other Fabletics leggings, these ones don't come in regular, short and tall</p><p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5/5</p><p>White is probably one of the most unflattering colours you can choose for a pair of leggings, except for this pair from Fabletics. We love how fresh and clean we looked wearing these, and the bright white colour is great for summer. We've been wearing ours with white trainers, a crop top and a denim jacket for weeks, and we're obsessed.</p><p>They're actually incredibly flattering because they're designed with the highest compression fabric possible to hold you in without restricting your range of movement.</p><p>We also love the 7/8 length, because it makes it possible to wear longer socks with dad trainers for a '90s vibe.</p><p>The waist sucks in your tummy and falls exactly where we like it to — just above the smallest part of your waist but not so high or so tight that it causes an unflattering muffin top.</p><p>Don't like the white colour? Don't worry. These leggings are available in 33 different colours.</p><h2>Which is the best material for leggings?</h2><p>If you want leggings to lounge around in, soft cotton leggings will be your go-to.</p><p>Cotton is a breathable material that will keep you feeling fresh, and is generally very comfortable to wear all day long.</p><p>However, it's worth mentioning that cotton doesn't hold up so well to stretching and although it's strong, over-wearing it can result in a loss of shape. Choosing a cotton blend with Lycra or Spandex is therefore a good option for adding stretch to your leggings.</p><p>If you want something longer-lasting, a pair of polyester leggings are a good idea as they're water-resistant and sweat-wicking, making them a very popular choice for activewear.</p><h2>What are the most comfortable leggings?</h2><p>If you want to feel cool and comfortable in the warmer months, bamboo has become an incredibly popular sustainable fabric choice for leggings, as it's highly moisture-absorbent, eco-friendly and has a similar look and feel to cotton.</p><p>For the cooler months, wool or thermal leggings could be your best option: while a little pricier, it's perfect for keeping pockets of air trapped and holding in warmth.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqysp2Wjmrmmr9OsZnFuYmuAeoKOm5ysrF2hsqizyKeerGc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./miley-cyrus-apologizes-again-2017-comments-about-hip-hop.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Miley Cyrus Apologizes Again for 2017 Comments About Hip-Hop">&larr;
