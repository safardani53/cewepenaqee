The best hair masks are known for their ability to smooth, hydrate, and detangle — all from inside your shower. Celebrities like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Halle Berry</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Jessica Chastain</a> swear by them to get red-carpet ready and maintain glossy, healthy hair. The results are both quick and promising, so PEOPLE Tested stepped into the shower to trial 30 versions.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Hair masks bring higher levels of repair and hydrating ingredients deeper into the hair,” says Gregory Patterson, a celebrity hairstylist who’s appeared on Project Runway and worked with stars like Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. Like souped-up conditioners, these formulas are made to leave your hair looking and feeling like its best self after a single application.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To figure out which deep treatments do the most work, we tested 30 popular hair masks, evaluating them carefully for consistency, efficacy, and final results. 10 of them stood out so much, we’re already stocking up.

It applies with a creamy, lightweight feel that instantly absorbs and makes every strand of hair feel equally nourished and coated. After just a few uses, its patented bond builder delivers noticeable results in hair health and softness. This is done through targeting broken disulfide bonds (aka repairing the protein structures of the hair shaft).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our tester, who has coily hair and tends to get single-strand knots or all-over tangles, found that this mask notably helped cut down on both issues. And because she was experiencing less tangles and knots, she also found that the mask cut down on overall hair shedding.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This mask is ideal for all hair types and is especially great for adding bounce and definition to curls — our tester raved that hers were "popping" (although we would still recommend applying it with your favorite moisturizing leave-in as she did feel that her hair wasn't as moisturized as when she uses her typical leave-in and mousse combination).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Overall, this mask makes hair look and feel better with each use — our tester said her hair feels much healthier even after just using the mask once a week for two weeks. An added bonus: The alluring scent is a nice added touch — it’s not overpowering and makes you feel like you’ve just stepped into your favorite luxury salon.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 100 mL/3.3 fl. oz. | <strong>Hair Type:</strong> All hair types, especially dry and frizzy hair | <strong>Star Ingredients:</strong> Bis-aminopropyl diglycol dimaleate (bond builder) | <strong>Silicones:</strong> Yes | <strong>Sulfates:</strong> No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-runner-up-best-overall-drunk-elephant-silkamino-mega-moisturizing-masker></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Runner Up, Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Drunk Elephant Silkamino Moisturizing Masker</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sephora Drunk Elephant Silkamino Mega-Moisturizing Masker" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/YIzA9exwQ2UKfed0fRcM5yrm05A=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/drunkelephant-e1f45e7b24364e54b2fe7505c516b1a2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel/Consistency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Efficacy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hair Look & Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=0><p>So lightweight, you’ll barely notice the texture</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Never leaves buildup and makes hair feel truly refreshed and bouncy</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Hydrolized silk and amino acids deliver a ton of softening and noticeable smoothness</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This is one of the lightest, airiest hair masks you’ll ever try, specifically designed for a no-buildup finish. Although it feels even less noticeable than conditioner, it manages to pack plenty of deep-conditioning hydration. Our tester dubbed this her "new favorite hair mask" and raved about how well it repaired her tailbone-length hair which hadn't been cut in almost a year. After using this mask for two weeks, she quips, "I almost cancelled my haircut!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Whether your hair is suffering the aftereffects of too many rounds of bleach — or just feeling dry — a blend of hydrolyzed silk, silk amino acids, and silk sericin instantly smooth and soften every strand. Use it on any hair texture for bouncy, healthy results. We love how it feels like a pro-level deep conditioning treatment you can easily do in your shower (our tester also used it as a pre-shampoo treatment for extra moisturization). It also makes heat styling even easier, almost like it’s giving your hair a complete reset.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 210 mL/7 oz. | <strong>Hair Type:</strong> All hair types, especially dry or color-treated hair | <strong>Star Ingredients:</strong> Hydrolyzed silk, silk amino acids, silk sericin | <strong>Silicones:</strong> No | <strong>Sulfates:</strong> No</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>People / Mollie Pendexter</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-dry-hair-christophe-robin-regenerating-mask-with-prickly-pear-oil></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Dry Hair</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Christophe Robin Regenerating Mask</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nordstrom Christophe Robin Regenerating Mask with Prickly Pear Oil" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/hHYcpMyMfWVK6XGdsfphH_aesMQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Christophe-Robin-Regenerating-Mask-with-Rare-Prickly-Pear-Oil-f506789cac8940279a43d8f7eb3e4a1d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel/Consistency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Efficacy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hair Look & Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>Significantly cuts down on split ends and improves overall smoothness</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Prickly pear oil deeply nourishes and gives results after just one use</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Gives hair a silky-smooth finish and glossy shine</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list"><li><p>We couldn’t find any!</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This creamy, spreadable mask applies like a dream from root to ends. It’s one of the most deeply nourishing formulas we tried, thanks to a triple threat of prickly pear oil, ceramides, and vitamin F complex. Together, they help smooth, nourish, and seal split ends for hair that feels unbelievably silky.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After one use, you’ll notice that hair instantly feels softer and looks glossier. Our tester applied it for five minutes at a time she washed her hair (about twice a week) and stepped things up notch by using her scalp massager during the treatment. She marveled at how "clean" and moisturized her hair felt. While it didn't totally repair split ends, it goes a long way in smoothing them over and reviving them from a dry, brittle state. Also worth noting; We love the pretty scent, which makes it feel extra decadent.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 250 mL | <strong>Hair Type:</strong> All hair types, especially dry or damaged hair | <strong>Star Ingredients:</strong> Prickly pear oil, ceramides, vitamin F complex | <strong>Silicones:</strong> No | <strong>Sulfates:</strong> No</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Maria Bouselli</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-curly-or-natural-hair-pattern-treatment-mask></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Curly or Natural Hair</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Pattern Treatment Mask</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sephora Pattern Treatment Mask" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/5X2nczMPDd8GmCVjbHjHbZPfvmw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Pattern-Treatment-Mask-0eb772e724b14d63af469ebbcb1bc8e2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel/Consistency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Efficacy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hair Look & Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1.5><li readability=-1><p>Watery gel texture coats curls and coils without weighing them down</p></li><li readability=0><p>Rice water ferment doesn’t leave any oily residue behind, yet deeply hydrates and softens</p></li><li readability=1><p>Leaves all curl patterns feeling silky, bouncy, and defined</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list"><li><p>We couldn’t find any!</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Curls, coils, and tight textures will drink up every bit of this hydrating mask, which smells like the most delicious mix of orange blossom and geranium and comes from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Tracee Ellis Ross</a>' haircare brand, Pattern. The texture — an easy-to-apply, watery gel — easily coats hair without weighing it down or leaving an oily residue behind. It’s infused with rice water ferment and moringa seed extract to leave all curl patterns feeling silky, pampered, and defined. In testing, it earned a callout for how soft and light it left curls feeling. The mask also noticeably cuts down on frizz and flyaways, and is a great option for quickly detangling your hair: All you have to do is apply and run your fingers through once. Our tester raves, "The frizz level, even after blowdrying and straightening, was considerably less than usual. I did not experience the usual baby hairs that stick straight up after I straighten."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 15 oz. | <strong>Hair Type:</strong> Curly | <strong>Star Ingredients:</strong> Rice water ferment, moringa seed extract | <strong>Silicones:</strong> No | <strong>Sulfates:</strong> No</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Alyssa Kingham</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-deep-conditioning-dae-deep-conditioning-hair-treatment></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Deep Conditioning</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>dae Deep Conditioning Treatment</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sephora dae Deep Conditioning Treatment" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/uFyN_GOzEh8M4nEQQBtZgJXQdW4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/dae-Deep-Conditioning-Hair-Treatment-29bcc6d5d17c40ed862ab7acea358a78.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel/Consistency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Efficacy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hair Look & Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>Nourishing oils make hair feel healthier and protect against breakage</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Makes hair feel dramatically softer and silkier after just one use</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Detangles and reduces frizz as you apply</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you have dry, damaged hair that needs a hydrating boost, this mask is the one. The formula’s nourishing blend of moringa leaf extract, coconut oil, and jojoba seed oil helps bring back moisture and protect against breakage. It spreads easily over wet hair and feels light and creamy as you work it in, detangling and reducing frizz for a silky-soft finish. In testing, it earned a callout for delivering noticeable results after just one use — although the deep-conditioning effects didn’t seem to be cumulative or last quite as long as we wanted them to.

It seems the effort is worth it: The ingredient is packed with antioxidants and vitamin C that help invigorate damaged hair. Combined with vitamin E (another antioxidant powerhouse), it hydrates, detangles, and deeply nourishes even the driest, bleach-fried hair. The even consistency goes on just like a conditioner, but imparts considerably more softening hydration. We love how regular use makes hair smoother and less tangled. It also received a callout for reducing damage from heat tools and making split ends stronger and less likely to occur.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 250 mL | <strong>Hair Type:</strong> Dry, bleached, permed, or relaxed hair | <strong>Star Ingredients:</strong> Fiaschetto tomato extract, Vitamin E | <strong>Silicones:</strong> Yes | <strong>Sulfates:</strong> No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-lightweight-sachajuan-hair-repair></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Lightweight</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sachajuan Hair Repair</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Dermstore Sachajuan Hair Repair" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/ErdHDpZZeeLW3nWpVVzX6TACFV4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Sachajuan-Hair-Repair-1a2d97192186480cb941b5b08d58206e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dermstore</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel/Consistency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Efficacy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hair Look & Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1.5><li readability=1><p>Algae extracts and wheat proteins make hair feel stronger, smoother, and hydrated</p></li><li readability=0><p>So lightweight, it truly feels like a regular conditioner</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Makes hair feel almost unbelievably soft</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For those that like their hair masks to feel as light as conditioner, this one felt so much like one that we were initially skeptical of its abilities. After one application, we were believers. Made for all hair types, this repairing mask is formulated with algae extracts and wheat proteins to strengthen hair follicles, guard against breakage, and smooth split ends. Some multitaskers fall short, but this one aced our test.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Once it goes on, there’s an instant hydrating effect that reduces frizz and makes the ends of your hair look healthier. In testing, it received a callout for how soft it made hair feel — far beyond the powers of a regular conditioner. It also helps detangle hair and make it smoother whether you air-dry or style with hot tools. The one thing we wished for was an alternate packaging option. While a little goes a long way for most hair types, those with long hair might find it too finicky to pump the amount of hair mask needed to cover every strand.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 250 mL/8.4 fl. oz. | <strong>Hair Type:</strong> All hair types, especially damaged or color-treated hair | <strong>Star Ingredients:</strong> Algae extract, wheat proteins, castor oil | <strong>Silicones:</strong> Yes | <strong>Sulfates:</strong> No</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Shannon McHugh</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-thin-hair-shu-uemura-ultimate-reset-hair-mask></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Thin Hair</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Shu Uemura Ultimate Reset Hair Mask</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sephora Shu Uemura Ultimate Reset Hair Mask" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/dZS46lftBBKV1taSHxDMleCvFms=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Shu-Uemura-Ultimate-Reset-Treatment-Mask-bc38b2b0d2ec40a1a94ac580a281203f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=0><p>Rice extract strengthens hair with antioxidants and vitamins, making it look and feel healthier</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Hair feels softer and less damaged both instantly and over time</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Works well on all hair types and is great for nourishing fine hair without weighing it down</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list"><li><p>We couldn’t find any!</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Rice extract is the star of this strengthening mask, which brings fresh life to dry and damaged hair. Enriched with minerals, antioxidants, and vitamins B and E, it’s formulated to protect your hair from damage and improve elasticity. It works well on all hair types, but we were especially impressed at how intensely it hydrated and softened fine hair without weighing it down or making it feel greasy. The super creamy texture coats evenly and works quickly. Not only does it provide instant nourishment, it also helps hair feel healthier and less damaged with each subsequent application.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 200 mL/6 oz. | <strong>Hair Type:</strong> All hair types, especially very damaged hair and fine hair | <strong>Star Ingredients:</strong> Rice extract | <strong>Silicones:</strong> Yes | <strong>Sulfates:</strong> No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-thick-hair-fable--mane-holiroots-repairing-hair-mask></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Thick Hair</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Fable & Mane HoliRoots Hair Mask</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sephora Fable &amp;amp; Mane HoliRoots Repairing Hair Mask" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/JQFJQw_cyyICTFhl3iam6Sxp4c4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Fable-Mane-HoliRoots-Repairing-Hair-Mask-9d898384b2c24e1895dfb12f853571c2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel/Consistency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Efficacy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hair Look & Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1.5><li readability=2><p>Coconut cream, mango butter, and banana create a delicious scent and creamy texture that feels great</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Intensely moisturizing formula helps smooth and reduce frizz</p></li><li readability=-1><p>A tiny bit goes a long way — we were impressed at how much hydration it delivered</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=0><p>While the fruity scent is delicious, it might be too strong for some</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Can be too heavy for those with thin or oily hair</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We don’t recommend eating your hair masks, but this one truly smells good enough to lick the tub. The tropical scent is all down to the ingredients: coconut cream, mango butter, and banana. Together, this trio of fruits creates the mask’s rich texture and helps smooth, moisturize, and strengthen your hair. While we absolutely loved the delicious fragrance, it’s one of the more strongly scented masks we’ve tried, so we can see this being overpowering for some.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Remember that a little goes a long way: A small scoop imparts serious smoothing, frizz-reducing powers and intense hydration, making it the perfect choice for those with dry hair; however, thinner hair types may find that this actually leaves your hair looking slightly greasy, so it's recommended to use on thicker or coarse hair types.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 237 mL/8 oz. | <strong>Hair Type:</strong> All hair types, especially natural hair | <strong>Star Ingredients:</strong> Coconut cream, banana, mango butter | <strong>Silicones:</strong> No | <strong>Sulfates:</strong> No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-things-to-consider-before-buying-hair-masks></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Things to Consider Before Buying Hair Masks</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Hair Type</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Like with other <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hair products</a>, your hair type is the most important determining factor when shopping for hair masks. Some formulas made for extremely dry hair will overpower fine hair types, while masks not designed for curls and coils can fall short in delivering bounce and definition. The easiest way to do this is just to read the label. “Look for hair masks for your specific hair type,” says Patterson. “They exist.” One general tip he has for anyone with fine hair: Avoid heavier bases with oils and butters. Instead, try a formula like the Sachajuan Hair Repair, our lightweight winner that goes on just like a regular conditioner, but delivers significantly more intense results.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Ingredients</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Hydrating ingredients are key for any hair mask. Patterson loves anything that’s rich in amino acids or vitamins, like aloe vera. He also looks for protective ingredients like glycerin, which forms a “protective layer around the hair strand,” effectively trapping moisture. Many of the winners on our list are formulated with powerful hydrators and antioxidant-rich vitamins that help make your hair feel healthier and stronger. Patterson also recommends keratin or “keratin-like ingredients” that rebuild broken bonds, reinforcing the structure of your hair. Our overall winner, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Olaplex No.8 Bond Intense Moisture Mask</a>, relies on a patented bond-building molecule to do exactly that.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to ingredients you should look out for, Patterson says sulfates are his biggest red flag. “They’re very stripping and drying and will fade out your chemical treatments quicker than anything,” he says. All ten of our winners are sulfate-free, so you don’t have to worry about dryness with any of these formulas. Silicones, however, are trickier. Some of the winners on our list contain them — and we’ve indicated wherever they’re present in the formula — but Patterson says their presence isn’t necessarily a bad thing. The ingredient is absolutely safe for your hair, but the challenge is that they can be heavy and build up on your hair fibers, causing a feeling of residue or heaviness. Just make sure to thoroughly rinse out your hair mask and you’ll avoid that potential problem.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-we-tested></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How We Tested</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our testers evaluated 30 hair masks over a period of two weeks, using them at least once a week, and up to three times if we were testing on dry hair textures that needed additional moisture. After we shampooed, we swapped out our regular conditioners for a small scoop of hair mask. After rinsing the nourishing formulas, we went ahead and styled as usual — air-dry or towel-dry for some, hot tools for others. Our testers took before-and-after photos of their hair to show the immediate results. After two weeks of deep treatment, we rated each mask’s consistency, performance, and impact on our hair. Each attribute was given a score of 1-5 and the numerical scoring was taken into consideration along with the individual testers' comments. Of course, our overall winner earned perfect scores across all attributes.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq-f714b620-9a14-422c-9a13-317c819e7da4></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=50><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active"><p><span class=accordion__title>What do hair masks do?</span></p><p>Think of everything your conditioner does, magnified and multiplied. “Because they’re left on for much longer than traditional conditioners, they’re able to get more work done,” says Patterson.

The first problem occurs when you use a mask that isn’t designed to work for your hair type — so always pay attention to the label. The second happens when you rush the rinsing process. “The number-one reason your mask will build up is because it hasn’t been fully and completely rinsed,” he says. Spend a few extra minutes under the shower, and make sure you get every trace of product out before you dry your hair.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>How often should you use hair masks?</span></p><p>It’s really up to the individual needs of your hair. Our testers used these masks anywhere from 1-3 times a week depending on their hair types and each mask’s recommendations. Patterson says that you can even get away with using them as infrequently as 2-3 times a month. Pay attention to how much moisture or repair you need and go from there.</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-trust-people></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Trust PEOPLE?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Sarah Y.
