It was said and it was picked in a different area of the studio. It was picked up by people in the control room and it was ultimately reported."</p><p>Multiple sources previously revealed that Ken's lucrative contract with <a href=#>the local flagship was recently renewed</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Another source said the 56-year-old was making around $500,000 a year when he was axed after using the curse to reference his colleague.</p><h2>TARGETED ATTACK?</h2><p>​​Insiders told The U.S. Sun that the <a href=#>New York</a> news anchor may have had a target on his back leading up to his dismissal earlier this month following the c**t incident.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More Ken Rosato ">Read More Ken Rosato</h2><p>"The station has been going for younger, less expensive talent," one source said of Ken's firing - that sentiment was echoed by several other insiders.</p><p>However, one source who was close to the incident confirmed that despite rampant rumors execs wanted him out, the 56-year-old newsman had his contract renewed in the months before his firing for <a href=#>allegedly using the vulgar term</a>.</p><p>"ABC had just renewed his contract. He still had plenty of time," one insider argued, adding that if they wanted him out, ABC wouldn't have renewed him.</p><p>A second insider close to Ken also confirmed that his contract with WABC was recently renewed, however, they added his firing was more complicated than that.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>"Nobody gets fired for <a href=#>saying a curse word</a>. Yes, it was terrible what he said, and he shouldn't have said it, but people don't get fired for using the C-word."</p><p>A rep for Ken declined to comment.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>THE INCIDENT</strong></h2><p><a href=#>The anchor</a>, who covered the <a href=#>New York City</a> area with WABC for two decades, <a href=#>disappeared</a> from the network earlier this month.</p><p>"It was the C-word that got him fired," an insider told The U.S. Sun.</p><p>"He said it on the hot mic, off-air."</p><p>Ken allegedly called his co-anchor Shirleen Allicot a "c**t," <a href=#>Page Six</a> reported.</p><p>A source told the outlet the anchor was "immediately let go" after the incident.</p><p>ABC would not disclose the vulgar remark that got Ken fired when the network told employees he wouldn't be returning.</p><p>A general manager at the station informed staffers that Ken "is no longer with WABC" in an internal email last week.</p><p>"We thank him for his years of service," the note said.</p><p>His bio was scrubbed from WABC's website last week.</p><p>There had been <a href=#>speculation</a> that Rosato has used a <a href=#>racial slur</a>, but the former anchor's representative quickly shut this down.</p><p>"Being fired for any racial slur is 100 percent inaccurate and untrue," the spokesperson told Page Six.</p><p>"Ken Rosato had a benchmark of 20 years at WABC of supporting all equality."</p><p>He started at the network as a freelancer in 2003 and was promoted to a full-time anchor position in 2007.</p><p>Rosato hosted the network's morning show alongside Allicot, Heather O’Rourke, and Sam Champion.</p><p>His previous <a href=#>Twitter</a> handle, @KenRosatoABC7, appeared to <a href=#>no longer be available</a> as of Monday evening.</p><p>Before that, the last tweet he sent out from the news desk was on May 2.</p><p>The former anchor's Instagram account is still up. Many <a href=#>fans left supportive comments</a> below his most recent picture.</p><p>"I'm done with ABC news unless they bring Ken back," one commenter said.</p><p>"Horrible if you were terminated," said another.</p><p>"ABC and their cancel culture is getting out of hand! Best of luck... Will miss seeing your cooking and funny stories!"</p><p>Others, however, recognized the alleged comment as unacceptable.</p><p>One person wrote on Twitter: "Ken Rosato was really good but this was dumb."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Someone else said: "Be a decent human - insulting other people only brings you down."</p><p>The firing comes shortly after <a href=#>Good Morning America</a> hosts <a href=#>TJ Holmes</a> and <a href=#>Amy Robach</a> left the program after it was revealed that they were having an affair.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/mic-shock-ken-rosatos-derogatory-817767355-3.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/taken-without-permission-https-www-817047464-2.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwYWl%2BdHyXaKKepl2nvLSt06hkrKylmbawecWlmKCflZl6qbvTZqSim12nsq6t0aRkbmhgoHqku82tqZqbpGQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./steven-crowley-spoke-about-amber-heard-cocaine-use-and-relationship-with-tasya-van-ree.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Steven Crowley Spoke About Amber Heard Cocaine Use And Relationship With Tasya Van Ree">&larr;
