"I try to go over in my mind why I ever dated or married men, and it's selfish and bad to say, but I think my driving force [was] children."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Three months into their marriage, Jameson described the couple's union as "everything" she hoped it would be.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"[Jessi] just <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>feeds my soul</a> and I'm happier and happier and happier every day I wake up next to her," she told PEOPLE.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Similar to Jameson, Lawless is no stranger to the public eye. The entrepreneur, a retired hairstylist who goes back to her former trade for charity events these days, also doubles as a social media personality. Lawless is active on Instagram and TikTok, garnering nearly two million followers on both platforms combined.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep scrolling for everything to know about Jameson's wife, Jessi Lawless.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-worked-as-a-barber-in-florida></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>She worked as a barber in Florida</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Jessi Lawless/Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lawless is an Alabama native who grew up in a small town before moving to Florida when she was 17 years old. She lived there for 22 years before moving to Las Vegas, where she currently resides with her wife.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although Lawless was born in Alabama, she and the Sunshine State go back even further. "I was conceived in Panama City Beach, Spring Break 1982 after my mother won a bikini contest," Lawless told PEOPLE with a laugh.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Prior to her Las Vegas move, Lawless — nicknamed "Flawless Lawless" — worked as a barber in Cocoa Beach, where she in part used her craft to host charity events to give back. In addition to her work as a barber, she hosts her own podcast (titled, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Born Lawless</a>) and is a part-owner of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Savage Sip Coffee</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-has-a-huge-following-on-tiktok></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>She has a huge following on TikTok</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lawless has racked up quite the following on social media, with nearly 2 million followers across <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>TikTok</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Instagram</a>.

"Who is this Jenna Can't Lose?" she recalls reading the star's social media handle. "It's Jenna f------ Jameson. Oh my God. All right, get your s--- together."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jameson added: "I was crushing on Jessi for a long time because she's quite large on TikTok and I love TikTok. I just scroll at night when I'm trying to calm down, and I just loved her perspective on things, I related to it. So I just started mass commenting her trying to get her attention, and it seemed to have worked."<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-her-dad-walked-jenna-down-the-aisle></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Her dad walked Jenna down the aisle</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Jenna Jameson/Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lawless and Jameson tied the knot at Little Church of the West in Nevada, the same place the former model's parents exchanged vows. The newlyweds have plans to throw a bigger wedding in the future, but for now, Lawless told PEOPLE they "run and gunned it." She added, "Very Las Vegas."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Only a few people in the pair's inner circle were in attendance at the intimate Vegas ceremony. Lawless told PEOPLE that her father was there and "walked Jenna down the aisle [since] her father passed away."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I was standing up there waiting for her, and I looked at the back of the church and I saw her standing there and I looked at my dad and I said, 'Dad.'
