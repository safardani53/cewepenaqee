Here are five facts about Kaci Conder that you might need to know if you are a fan!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kaci Conder is 18 years old now</h2><p>Born in 2005, Conder celebrates her birthday on the 4th of June every year. Taking the numbers, her current age is 18. She turned 18 this year on June 4.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>On the day of her birthday, she took to her Instagram handle to share a picture of herself donning a beautiful white off-shoulder one-piece dress. “Eighteen,” she captioned her post alongside a toast and sparkles emoji.</p><p>Although her birthday was on June 4, her birthday party came a little late. On July 23, 2023, she posted a couple of pictures of herself sitting in a limo while donning a black outfit. In the first picture, she was seen holding a bottle of champagne.

Currently, the name of the educational institution is unknown.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kaci Conder is the eldest child of her parents</h2><p>The English YouTuber is the eldest child of her parents, Joel Conder and Sarah Conder. Her father is a professional cameraman who previously ran a channel on Vimeo. Later, he created a YouTube channel, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dad V Girls</a>, that eventually led to their popularity.</p><p>Kaci’s parents gave birth to her while both of them were still in their teenage. In one of their Q&A videos, Joel and Sarah <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">opened up</a> about having a child during their teenage. Joel mentioned that he could never regret having Kaci because it led to the creation of his “amazing family.”</p><p>As for her mother, she stated that while it was not so good idea to have a baby as a teenager, it worked out pretty well. The parents have a great bond with Kaci and regularly share pictures through their social media handles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/kaci-condor-parents-siblings.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Kaci Condor alongside her parents and younger siblings at the Rixos Premium Seagate (Photo: Instagram)</p><p>Apart from her parents, Kaci has four younger sisters; Grace Condor (b. October 29, 2007), Sophie Condor (b. January 31, 2012), and Chloe Condor (b. January 13, 2018). On May 18, 2021, Joel and Sarah revealed that their family of six was going to expand as Sarah was pregnant.</p><p>Later, on August 2, 2021, it was revealed that another baby girl was joining the Conder family. The couple welcomed their newest addition on October 29, 2021. They didn’t immediately reveal their baby girl’s name, but it was later <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.instagram.com/p/CaFjF-Qhtya/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">revealed</a> to be Madison Condor.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kaci Condor’s height, weight, and tattoo</h2><p>Considering that Conder is just 18 years old now, she has an average height as well as weight. As per reports, she stands at a height of 5 feet 7 inches or 1.70 meters and weighs around 59 kg or 130 lbs.</p><p>Likewise, many have asked if the social media personality has any tattoos. And the answer is yes! Condor seems to have only one tattoo at the moment. She got her first tattoo – three butterflies on her right arm – at the age of 17, while in Spain, with the consent of her parents.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>In July 2022, she <a href=# data-type=link data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb_F1S_lelQ" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted</a> some pictures of herself getting a tattoo via her Instagram stories. In one of the pictures, she wrote, “Btw in Spain u can get a tattoo at 17 w parents consent and both my parents agreed I could get it done xx.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is Kaci Condor dating a boyfriend?</h2><p>As of this writing, Conder’s relationship status remains unknown. She is relatively private about her dating life, so there is little to no information about it. So, it’s better to assume that she is currently single until anything changes in her love life.</p><p>That said, she has <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://gbissue.com/relationship/kaci-conder-boyfriend/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">talked</a> a bit about dating and relationships. She once mentioned in one of her YouTube videos that she doesn’t have much experience with boys and dating as she attends an all-girls school.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kaci-conder-age-parents-height-net-worth.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Kaci Conder’s present relationship status is single (Photo: Instagram)</p><p>Likewise, she stated that she wasn’t ready to get into a committed relationship and is mostly focusing on her life as a teenager and aims to advance in her career.</p><p>Nonetheless, it was once rumored that she was dating fellow social media star Harvey Mills. The rumors of their romance started after a social media interaction in October 2020. But neither of them has confirmed or denied these rumors.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kaci Condor has a healthy fan following</h2><p>Being a well-known YouTube personality has surely impacted Conder’s social media handles, as she currently relishes a healthy fan following.</p><p>She goes by the username of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@kaci.jay</a> on Instagram, where she has 108 posts and over 778 thousand followers as of now. As for <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/tag/tiktok/ rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok</a>, she has garnered over 1.2 million followers and goes by the same username as her Instagram handle.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>However, compared to those numbers, her followers on Twitter is very much less as she only has 145 followers there. It might be because she isn’t active there and is yet to share any posts. Currently, it seems she is not available on Facebook.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kaci Condor started YouTube in July 2018</h2><p>After making regular appearances on her family channel, Dad V Girls, Conder gained quite a popularity. Soon, she decided to make her own YouTube channel, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kaci-Jay</a>, and she did so on July 1, 2018.</p><p>On the 30th of July, she posted her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">first video</a> titled “Primark Spray on Foundation FAIL.” Ever since then, she has been posting videos on a regular basis. The content of the videos varied from each other such as makeup, challenges, pranks, and vlogging videos.</p><p>As time passed, her channel’s growth increased. As a result, she started to get brand endorsement deals from different products such as Missguided, Pretty Little Thing, Spotify, and other fashion and lifestyle brands.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Later, she launched her own line of merchandise on the website <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">kacijay.shop</a>. The merch line included Kaci-Jay Makeup Bag, a Makeup brush that came in pink and rose-red colors, and many more.</p><p>With such a fruitful career, it must be sure that she has been earning well and has a decent net worth. As per social blade, Kaci Conder’s YouTube channel generates an estimated yearly income of $2.3K – $37.4K. Additionally, her net worth is estimated to be around $500,000.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6yfnl6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e8qamqJlk6S7pbHRZpignV2lrrOxza2qZqCVnrSpwIynnK1lp6S%2FtbSO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./suri-cruise-no-plans-to-take-baby-gap-modeling-deal.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="No Plans to Take Baby Gap Modeling Deal">&larr;
