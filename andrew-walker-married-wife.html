In most of those Hallmark Channel television movies, Walker tends to portray the character of a man looking for love.</p><p>But, if we speak of the actor in real life, he is actually in a blissful marital relationship with his wife, Cassandra Troy Walker, aka Cassandra Troy — an entrepreneur, adventurer, and fitness enthusiast. Here is a look at his married life!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How long has Andrew Walker been married?</h2><p>Walker first met his future wife, Troy, in early 2004. As Troy explained in her <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.instagram.com/p/CJ3ixoFpIsR/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Instagram post</a> of January 10, 2021, it all started after they discovered their mutual love for nature and went on a hiking trip to Mont-Tremblant.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>“In the first week we met (circa 2004!), we discovered each others love for nature. It started with a hiking trip in @monttremblant followed by countless small wilderness adventures, and some big big trips which are always centered around being in nature,” she had written.</p><p>So the now-married couple met around 2004; their love for nature brought them closer, and after getting to know each other closely, they eventually started dating.</p><p>As years passed by, Walker and Troy’s relationship became stronger and stronger. There seems to be only one thing lacking — a wedding. That was also fulfilled when they walked down the aisle and shared the wedding vows on June 7, 2012.</p><p>Since their wedding, the couple has always been together and helped and supported each other no matter what. Soon after their marriage, in 2013, they even launched a locally-sourced and cold-pressed juice brand, Clover Juice, based in Los Angeles, West Hollywood.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Andrew-Walker-with-Wife-Cassandra-Troy.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Andrew Walker with his wife, Cassandra Troy, in 2023 (Photo: Instagram)</p><p>On June 7, 2014, Troy <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.instagram.com/p/o8w02RJS8H/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">marked</a> her second wedding anniversary with her husband via Instagram. She shared a selfie taken at a beach and wrote, “Happy 2 years to my favorite partner in crime.”</p><p>Several more happy instances could be found on the couple’s respective Instagram handles. And all of them depict the two’s blissful married life, filled with love, respect, and several adventures they have gone on together.</p><p>As of now, Walker has been together with his wife for around 19 years, out of which they have spent 11 years as a married couple. Troy marked her 11th wedding anniversary with her husband with a special post on Instagram.</p><p>Two days after their official 11th wedding anniversary and on Walker’s 44th birthday, on June 9, 2023, Troy <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.instagram.com/p/CtSGqOVSk9K/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted</a> a picture with her life partner and wrote a heartfelt caption. She mentioned that she is grateful every day that they get to spend this lifetime together.</p><p>“… and hopefully many many more lifetimes. Oh, and happy 11-year anniversary to us… and 19 years together. Time [flies] when you’re having fun!!” she added. Furthermore, she concluded her caption by adding, “ILY.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Andrew Walker and Cassandra Troy have two children</h2><p>Andrew and Troy have been blessed with two kids in their 11-year-long marital relationship. Both of their children are sons; they are named West Byron Walker and Wolf Reinhard Walker. The couple’s first child is West Byron Walker, <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.instagram.com/p/CCsP6OwpwGk/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">born</a> on July 16, 2015.</p><p>More than three years after welcoming their first child, the duo decided to relaunch their juice brand under a new name. Their juice brand was initially named Clover Juice, which they opened from the savings they made by not having a grand wedding.</p><p>They named their juice brand Little West, and as per Troy, she and Andrew <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/clover-juice-is-now-little-west-300716591.html rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">chose</a> the name after their eldest son, West, and their shared love of the west coast. “As excited as we are about the new name and look, our process hasn’t changed at all,” she added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Andrew-Walker-wife-Cassandra-Troy-sons.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Andrew Walker and his wife, Cassandra Troy Walker, with their sons West Byron Walker and Wolf Reinhard Walker (Photo: Instagram)</p><p>On July 12, 2019, Troy <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz0b3SzpjbC/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced</a> on Instagram that she was pregnant with her second child with her spouse.
