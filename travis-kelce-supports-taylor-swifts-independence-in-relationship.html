The pair dated for nearly six years before calling it quits in April, <a href=#>with a source exclusively telling Us</a> that “fame factored into their split.”</p><p>“Joe is very shy and never liked all of the attention that came with dating one of the most popular singers in the world,” the insider shared at the time.</p><p>While discussing the inspiration behind “Peace” in 2020’s <a href=# rel=noopener>Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions</a>, Swift confessed, “If you’re going to be in my life, I feel like there’s a certain amount that comes with it that I can’t stop from happening. This song was basically, like, is it enough. Is the stuff that I can control enough to block out the things that I can’t?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Travis-Kelce-Makes-Taylor-Swift-Feel-Safe-and-Protected-and-Supports-Her-Independence-Source-497.jpg><p>Kelce, for his part, <a href=#>has been vocal about embracing the media circus</a> that comes with pursuing Swift. “We’re learning with the paparazzi just taking photos from all over the place, It comes with it. You’ve got a lot of people that care about Taylor, and for good reason,” he said in a press conference earlier this month. “You just have to keep living, learning and enjoying the moments. At the end of the day, I have always been good at compartmentalizing and being able to stay focused. I will just keep rolling with that.”</p><p>The NFL star first spoke about his desire to meet Swift over the summer, revealing in July that he wrote his phone number on a friendship bracelet that ultimately didn’t get to Swift during her Eras Tour shows in Kansas City.</p><p>However, he revealed in early September that <a href=#>he reached out to Swift after the missed bracelet exchange</a> and invited her to come see him “rock the stage” at Arrowhead Stadium. Swift <a href=#>attended her first Chiefs game</a> on September 24, and later hung out with Kelce and his teammates <a href=#>at a private event</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Swift added fuel to the relationship rumors when <a href=#>she was spotted at the Chief’s October 1 game</a> against the New York Jets at MetLife Stadium with several of her celebrity friends. The “Exile” singer attended her third game <a href=#>in support of Kelce on October 12</a> when the Chiefs beat the Denver Broncos at home.</p><p>The pair were then <a href=#>spotted on back-to-back dates in New York City</a> over the weekend after Swift and Kelce made surprise appearances on <a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a> on Saturday, October 14.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatqpGrtrR5yp6jnJ1dqMKxvM6rq6xlpJbGrbvRZqqwoZapwG61zZ2cqZ2embKvr8RmoKdlopq5osDIqKWsoJmlfA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-ghostemane-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Ghostemane Dating Now">&larr;
