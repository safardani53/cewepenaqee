The social media-savvy pastor is the definition of a family man and often shares parenting advice as well as sketches and skits starring his kids. He has one son, Darrion Perry, and two daughters, Dru and Kenna Perry. His wife is Lyndsey Perry.</p><p>Recently, Billy's daughter Dru did the sweetest thing in his honor, and the doting father couldn't help but share it on his TikTok page. Keep reading for the meaning behind the tattoo.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bill Vsco Facebook</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">A daughter got a special tattoo in her dad's handwriting to honor him.</h2><p>Billy shared a sweet video Dru filmed of her showing him a tattoo she had recently gotten.</p><p>‚ÄúSince I was little my dad has always told me 'you need me, you call me.' So the other day I had him write it down so I can get it tattooed," Dru said as she revealed the phrase written vertically up her inner arm.</p><p>She continued: "So now I‚Äôm going to show it to him and see his reaction."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@billyvsco href=#>@billyvsco</a><p>I know I shared the pictures, but I never shared the video.

When she tells him that it is, tears start to well up in his eyes. "Turn that thing off," he said, but it was already too late. The heartwarming moment had been captured. He hugged his daughter tightly.</p><p>In the comment section, folks were moved by Dru's sweet gift to her father. They also had a lot of praise for Billy.</p><p>One user wrote: "I‚Äôm crying this is so sweet."</p><p>Another said: "Billy is the dad we all need."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok/@billyvsco</span></figure><p>Others shared similar stories about handwritten tattoos they had gotten to honor someone else. "I did the same [with] my mom but I took 'te amo' from a letter she wrote me," read one comment.</p><p>Another user said her dad always said "we are here for each other no matter what." That said, she got the latter three words inked on her.</p><p>A third user noted they had plans to get a handwritten tattoo soon in honor of their late brother. "Seeing people get handwriting tattooed makes me so excited to get my big brothers name in his handwriting tattooed (he took his life in 2019)."</p><p>In another one of Billy's videos, followers can actually see Billy honoring his "you need me, you call me" promise when it comes to parenting his children.</p><p>In the video, it shows one of his daughters on the phone.
