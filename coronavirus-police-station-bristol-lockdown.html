The detainee has been given the appropriate medical attention and remains in custody at this time."</p><p>One member of the public who attended the station to give a statement was told he would have to remain at the station while it was 'under quarantine'.</p><p>He said: "After I gave the statement I went to the toilet, when I came out I was told 'we have some bad news'.</p><p>"They told me to stay after a Chinese national had been arrested at Patchway and the officers had come to Trinity.</p><p>"The stations were under quarantine. I was well looked after - the officers even managed to get a Dominos ordered."</p><h2>FEARS DISEASE HAS ALREADY ARRIVED</h2><p>Disease expert Professor Neil Ferguson <a href=#>fears the coronavirus could already have arrived in the UK</a> on one of the three flights a week from Wuhan, China, where the virus originated.</p><p>Passengers from China were waved into Britain with NO checks sparking fears the deadly killer coronavirus could spread to the UK.</p><p>Holidaymakers touching down at London Heathrow from Wuhan, where up to 10,000 people are thought to have become infected, were shocked as they were simply handed a leaflet and told to call NHS 111 if they felt ill.</p><p>At airports in other cities with direct flights to Wuhan, body temperatures of passengers arriving from China have been closely monitored.</p><p>But travellers arriving in the UK from the city were given leaflets explaining how they can seek help if they become unwell while in the UK.</p><p>Aircraft from the Chinese city are landing in an isolated area of Heathrow Terminal 4 to limit the potential spread of the infection.</p><p>One arrival today said: "All we got was a leaflet, that's it.</p><p>"It seems odd because I knew American cities were screening. I was not screened leaving Wahun, or in the UK. I didn't see anybody get screened. It would have made sense."</p><p>Officials say they have no plans to introduce blanket temperature screening of all passengers â€“ as the measure has failed in the past.</p><p>Public Health England has upgraded the coronavirus risk to the UK from "very low" to "low".</p><p>The Department of Health and Social Care said that from today enhanced monitoring will be in place from all direct flights from Wuhan to the UK.</p><p>A team of healthcare experts will now meet each direct flight aircraft to provide advice and support to those that feel unwell.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">most read in news</h2></p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>A patient is transported out of an airport in a sealed moving box in Fuzhou, Fujian Province</span><p>The once buzzing city of Wuhan has been reduced to a ghost town as the authorities there ban all travel on public transport.</p><p>Images from the Central Hospital of Wuhan show doctors in the intensive care unit wearing hazmat suits.</p><p>At least 20 medics in the country have also been infected with the highly contagious bug while treating patients, officials said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NINTCHDBPICT000556375279.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NINTCHDBPICT000556358352.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NINTCHDBPICT000556345350.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NINTCHDBPICT000556345328.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZn15fJFxaXFnk6S%2FsLrAr6CrraNivbC4yJycZquklsGqu81mmauho6m8rXnLqJqknJ%2Bsu3A%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-justin-baldoni-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Justin Baldoni Dating Now">&larr;
