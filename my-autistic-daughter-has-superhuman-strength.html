At the age of two, she can already count up to 300.</p><p>After appealing to the council for adaptation support two years ago, Taylor has decided to take matters into her own hands after growing sick of waiting.</p><p>The mum said she needs £1,000 to build the room and stop her little girl from harming herself.</p><p>She has so far managed to find a second-hand disability bed for £180, which when new is worth more than £1,000.</p><p>The bed is wipe-able and made of soft-play materials with high walls and can serve as a safe space for Isla during outbursts.</p><p>It also means Isla can sleep in a bed for the first time in months, after she destroyed her newest standard bed in 24 hours.</p><p>Taylor said she is unable to work to raise the money due to her care responsibilities for her two daughters.</p><p>She is currently given just four hours of respite a week from Milton Keynes Council.</p><p>Isla is also enrolled in Slate Row School in Milton Keynes but is regularly sent home, as her sensory issues mean she can't stand wearing clothes.</p><p>Taylor said: "I have to watch Isla literally all the time. It's impossible for me to work.</p><p>"It's like having a new baby in that you have to feed her, change her and wash her - but the worst bit is that you never know what she will do next.</p><p>"She's gorgeous and I love her to bits but her autism makes her the most destructive little girl.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"The doctors say she's a really severe and extreme case."</p><p>With the help of her friends, Taylor has now started a <a href=#>GoFundMe page</a> which has so far raised £700 of the £930 needed to give Isla a safe room.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">What is autism?</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is the medical name for autism: it's neurodevelopmental condition which affects children's behaviour, ability to communicate and socialise.</p><p>Being <a href=#>autistic</a> doesn't mean you have an illness or disease. It just means your brain works in a different way from other people.</p><p>Autism is also on a spectrum, so everyone experiences it differently.</p><p>It affects around one in 100 people in the UK and is three to four times more common in boys than in girls.</p><p><strong>Signs of autism in young children include:</strong></p><ul><li>not responding to their name</li><li>avoiding eye contact</li><li>not smiling when you smile at them</li><li>getting very upset if they do not like a certain taste, smell or sound</li><li>repetitive movements, such as flapping their hands, flicking their fingers or rocking their body</li><li>not talking as much as other children</li><li>not doing as much pretend play</li><li>repeating the same phrases</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57x56YpayYZIR5fo9rbGpnna56osHToqqtoZNisaLBxqGrnqpdna60edKup56qmKq6orqMrKurnZ6cwal7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./celebrity-mirror-selfies-photos-kim-kardashian-demi-lovato.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Hottest Pics Taken Of Stars Reflections  Hollywood Life">&larr;
