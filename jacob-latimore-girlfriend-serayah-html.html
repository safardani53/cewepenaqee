He has also starred in a couple of TV series, the most recent being The Chi, where he plays the protagonist Emmett.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Latimore is also an accomplished singer. He has released three albums to date and numerous singles. The actor is currently dating his <a href=# rel=follow>girlfriend</a>, Serayah.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Like Latimore, Serayah is also actively involved in the acting and the music industry.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Here is an in-depth look into the couple’s relationship and Serayah’s career.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>The Couple’s Relationship Timeline</h2><p>Having heard about each other through a common friend, Serayah and Latimore first met at the BET awards in 2015.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Their interaction had been very brief, as <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">recalled</a> by the couple. However, in those few moments, the actress had smitten Latimore with her beauty. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>With rumors speculating about their romance, the couple didn't make it official until May 2019. Serayah, in an interview at the Cardi B x Fashion Nova launch party, slyly <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">confirmed</a> the news of their dating. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>This is the first time Latimore has dated someone from this field of work. The actor <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">admits</a>&nbsp;it is tough for them with their busy schedule, but the pair constantly try to make time to visit each other.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The couple has not let their profession affect their personal life. Serayah is fine with his steamy scenes on screen and understands it is just his profession. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Serayah <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">credits</a> her relationship with helping her mature spiritually. She confessed that both of them have helped each other grow and survive through their past traumas.</p><p>The duo balances their relationship and career to help each other by being honest with each other. Their relationship has gotten stronger over time since they have each other’s back no matter what.&nbsp;</p><p>The pair constantly hype each other up through their social media. From promoting their songs to their achievements, they seem to be each other's biggest fans. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Latimore had also featured his girlfriend on the song titled ‘Caught Up.’&nbsp;</p><h2>Who is Serayah?</h2><p>Serayah is an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">actress</a> best known for her role as Tiana Brown on the TV show <a href=# rel=follow>Empire</a>. However, the series was canceled in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>She is also a singer who has made several soundtracks for the show in collaboration with her fellow cast members. Serayah loved singing and dancing from a young age.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>In an interview with Talk Nerdy With Us, she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">revealed</a>&nbsp;she wrote gospel songs at nine and was involved in youth choirs and dance teams.&nbsp;</p><p>She also watched iconic women in the music industry growing up. Artists like Destiny’s Child, Britney Spears, and Janet Jackson, among others, inspired her to be a performer.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In April 2020, Serayah released an album titled ‘Never Be The Same.’ The album featured three singles ‘Mr. Lover,’ ‘Never Be The Same,’ and ‘Miss You.’&nbsp;</p><p>When asked about the album, Serayah <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">opened up</a> that the songs were inspired by her relationship and emotions while being in love. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She further explained 2019 helped her finally reach a place of enlightenment, embarking on a journey of self-progression. This ultimately made her comfortable expressing her emotions reflected in the song.</p><h2>Serayah’s Upcoming Projects</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>On March 2021, Serayah sat down with LadyGunn and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">talked</a> about her upcoming projects. She promoted her two new movies Envy and Favorite Son, which will be released in 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>The actress utilized&nbsp;her time in COVID-19 quarantine fruitfully. She claimed she sent many self-tape auditions hoping to be a part of new projects.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>To remain constant with the music career as well, Serayah has expanded her team to strategize and put ideas together.</p><p>Similarly, she revealed she had been recording and is in the process of releasing her first album.</p><p>She confessed she had a single with Rick Ross called ‘Tell Me About Myself,’ which might release any time soon. The single is about her story, about how she went from nothing to something.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She gave a little sneak peek into her new album and said the genre she explored is “trap, soul, pop-ish.” From her voice to the album’s contents, Serayah is confident that her highly anticipated album would be on the Billboard.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnmpawsK6MpZitoZ2kv6Z5xqKppZ6inrKvsIysnKuZqZa1b7TTpqM%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./meet-danielle-from-love-is-blind-her-age-instagram-and-journey-with-nick.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="  Meet Danielle from Love Is Blind, her age, Instagram and journey with Nick    Wed 16 February 2022">&larr;
