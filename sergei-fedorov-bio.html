As a result, young Sergei decided to play ice hockey instead.</p><p>Subsequently, the future Hall of Famer honed his skills as Fedorov would spend all of his time practicing and developing his talents whenever he was not in school.</p><p>And, the rest is history because the USSR-born player turned out to be probably the best export of the USSR to the NHL.</p><h2>Sergei Fedorov: Career & Stats</h2><p>Before his NHL career, Fedorov was playing in the Soviet Union for the club he is managing now, CSKA Moscow.</p><p>But, in a stroke of luck, Sergei got to show his talents to the American audience when CSKA Moscow played in the pre-1990 Goodwill Games in Portland, Oregon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/fedorov-010.jpg><p>What followed after that is the stuff of legends as the Detroit Red Wings drafted the USSR-born player 74th overall in the 1989 NHL Entry Draft.</p><p>At the moment, no one would have imagined the impact Sergei would have not only for Detroit Red Wings but the NHL as a whole.</p><p>To illustrate, the 6-feet-2 center played for the Red Wings in a grand total of 1070 games.</p><p>And in those games, he scored 481 goals, provided 588 assists to his teammates, and scored 1182 points.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tyson Fury Net Worth: Bio, Fight Purse, Business, Cars, Wife Wiki >></a></strong></p><p>Also, the Hall of Famer won three Stanley Cups with the Red Wings in the years 1997, 1998, and 2002 as part of the “Russian Five” that included <strong>Viacheslav Fetisov</strong>, <strong>Igor Larionov</strong>, <strong>Vladimir Konstantinov</strong>, and <strong>Vyacheslav Kozlov.</strong></p><p>Besides, Sergei was also named the winner of the “oldest and most prestigious individual award in hockey,” the Hart Memorial Trophy, which is awarded to the NHL’s Most Valuable Player in 1994.</p><p>Also, Fedorov became a six-time All-Star with the Red Wings for his outstanding consistent service over the course of his 13 years of stay in Detroit.</p><p>However, the 1994 NHL MVP did not just play for the Red Wings but also played for three other NFL teams.</p><p>For instance, Fedorov played for the Mighty Duck of Anaheim, Columbus Blue Jackets, and Washington Capitals.</p><p>At the time of his retirement from the NHL, Sergei had played in an incredible 1431 games in which he scored 535 goals, assisted 820 times, and scored a further 1355 points.</p><p>Thus, on 9 November 2015, Fedorov was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame for his outstanding contributions to the NHL.</p><h3>International Career</h3><p>Since the very beginning of the sport, USSR (now Russia) has always been the best along with the U.S.</p><p>Therefore, it should come as no surprise that Fedorov has won just as much with his country as he did with the Red Wings.</p><p>To illustrate, Sergei was part of the Soviet team that won the World Championships gold for two consecutive years in 1989 and 1990.</p><p>The 6-feet-2 center won the silver medal in 1988 and gold in the 1989 World Junior Championships.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/fedorov-011.jpg><p>Furthermore, the six-time NHL All-Star played in the 1998 Olympics in Nagano and the 2002 Olympics in the U.S, where he won silver and bronze medals.</p><p>Similarly, Fedorov has played two times in the World Championships, winning the gold in 2008 and silver in 2010.</p><p>And, finally, the Hall of Famer appeared once in the World Cup of Hockey during the year 1996, in which he won a bronze medal.</p><p>In conclusion, Sergei was one of the best players in the USSR and the whole world, as suggested by his impressive haul of achievements.</p><p>In fact, only a handful of athletes, let alone ice hockey players boast the awards and recognition that Fedorov has garnered throughout his astonishing 26 years of playing career.</p><h3>Career Achievements and Highlights</h3><p>1998 All-Star Team-World Junior Championships</p><p>1991 NHL All-Rookie Team</p><p>1994 NHL First All-Star Team</p><p>NHL All-Stars Game 1992, 1994, 1996, 2001, 2002, 2003</p><p>1994 Hart Memorial Trophy (MVP Trophy)</p><p>NHL Player of the Year 1994 by The Sporting News</p><p>2003 Kharlamov Trophy</p><p>1994 Lester B.

Height & Body Measurements</h2><p>Currently, Sergei is 54&nbsp;years which is the prime age for most people to think about retirement from their careers.</p><p>However, being the competitor, Fedorov is, the Russian native is still involved in hockey as he is the general manager of CSKA Moscow in the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL).</p><p>Furthermore, the former Red Wings center stands at 6 feet 2 inches, which is pretty tall for an NHL player.</p><p>However, Sergei’s towering height helped him during his playing career as Fedorov’s outstretched hands helped steal the puck from the opposition.</p><p>Also, Sergei was one of the fastest skaters of his era due to his long legs.</p><p>Also, Fedorov weighs 93 kg (206 lb), which is the right weight according to his tall height.</p><p>What that suggests is, the former Red Wings center still hits the gym regularly to stay in shape. Now, that’s what I call a genuine athlete.</p><h2>How much is Sergei Fedorov worth? Net Worth & Salary</h2><p>As of 2020, Sergei has accrued a net worth of <strong>$50 million</strong>, mainly through his NHL salary and endorsements.</p><p>The USSR-born center was one of the best players to appear in the NHL, which is one of the highest paying leagues in the world.</p><p>As a result, nobody should be surprised by the 54-year old’s massive net worth. Also, Fedorov is a Russian; thus, his fan following is not just limited to the U.S but also in the USSR (now Russia).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/fedorov-013.jpg><p>Likewise, the former Red Wings center received <strong>$220,000</strong> for his first year in the NHL back in 1990.</p><p>After that, the 6-feet-2 Russian increased his earnings year after year due to his impressive performances.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rodrygo Bio: Career, Stats, Salary, Position, Age, Family Wiki >></a></strong></p><p>Consequently, in the year 1998, Sergei received the most lucrative salary of his career. To be precise, the USSR-born player earned <strong>$14 million</strong> during 1998.</p><p>Paying such an amount of wages for a defender was unheard of during that time, but Fedorov more than made it up with his outstanding ice hockey rink performances.</p><p>Likewise, the 54-year old’s second-biggest payday came in 2003 when he earned <strong>$10 million</strong> playing for the Mighty Duck of Anaheim.</p><p>Finally, in the last season of his career in 2008, the USSR-born center earned <strong>$4 million</strong> with the Washington Capitals.</p><p>At the end of his career, Fedorov had amassed <strong>$65.5 million</strong> just from salaries. However, a certain tax percentage needs to be paid to the government, which must have put a considerable dent in his income.</p><p>Nonetheless, Sergei is one of the wealthiest hockey players out there currently. Judging by Fedorov’s coaching career, I am sure that his net worth will only increase.</p><h2>Net Worth of Sergei Fedorov in Different Currencies</h2><p><span>Here is the net worth of Sergei in different currencies, including the Euro and Pound Sterling.</span></p><table><tbody><tr><td><b>Currency</b></td><td><b>Net Worth</b></td></tr><tr><td><b>Euro</b></td><td><span>€<span data-sheets-value='{"1":3,"3":42928750}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":14851,"3":{"1":2,"2":"#,##0"},"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"12":0,"14":{"1":2,"2":2236962},"15":"Inconsolata, monospace, arial, sans, sans-serif","16":11}' data-sheets-formula='=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:USDEUR")*R[-1]C[-1]'>42,928,750</span>&nbsp;</span></td></tr><tr><td><b>Pound Sterling</b></td><td><span>£<span data-sheets-value='{"1":3,"3":36214250}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":14851,"3":{"1":2,"2":"#,##0"},"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"12":0,"14":{"1":2,"2":2236962},"15":"Inconsolata, monospace, arial, sans, sans-serif","16":11}' data-sheets-formula='=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:USDGBP")*R[-2]C[-1]'>36,214,250</span>&nbsp;</span></td></tr><tr><td><b>Australian Dollar</b></td><td><span>A$<span data-sheets-value='{"1":3,"3":66713800}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":14339,"3":{"1":2,"2":"#,##0"},"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"14":{"1":2,"2":2236962},"15":"Inconsolata, monospace, arial, sans, sans-serif","16":11}' data-sheets-formula='=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:USDAUD")*R[-3]C[-1]'>66,713,800</span>&nbsp;</span></td></tr><tr><td><b>Canadian Dollar</b></td><td><span>C$<span data-sheets-value='{"1":3,"3":61602249.99999999}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":14339,"3":{"1":2,"2":"#,##0"},"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"14":{"1":2,"2":2236962},"15":"Inconsolata, monospace, arial, sans, sans-serif","16":11}' data-sheets-formula='=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:USDCAD")*R[-4]C[-1]'>61,602,250</span>&nbsp;</span></td></tr><tr><td><b>Indian Rupee</b></td><td><span>₹<span data-sheets-value='{"1":3,"3":3742387500.0000005}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":14339,"3":{"1":2,"2":"#,##0"},"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"14":{"1":2,"2":2236962},"15":"Inconsolata, monospace, arial, sans, sans-serif","16":11}' data-sheets-formula='=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:USDINR")*R[-5]C[-1]'>3,742,387,500</span>&nbsp;</span></td></tr><tr><td><b>BitCoin</b></td><td><span>฿<span data-sheets-value='{"1":3,"3":763.8325}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":14339,"3":{"1":2,"2":"#,##0"},"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"14":{"1":2,"2":2236962},"15":"Inconsolata, monospace, arial, sans, sans-serif","16":11}' data-sheets-formula='=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:USDBTC")*R[-6]C[-1]'>764</span>&nbsp;</span></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Sergei Fedorov: Wife & Family</h2><p>The 50-year-old is happily married to his wife, <strong>Corrina Fedorov</strong>.
