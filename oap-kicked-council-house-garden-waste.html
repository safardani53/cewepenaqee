They've offered me one bedroomed flat instead but this is my home.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>"I've always lived here, I've lived here all my life, since I was a child.</p><p>"If I left here I would probably be homeless.</p><p>"I haven't been failed by the system, I've been screwed by the system.</p><p>"It's my childhood home, I've seen the whole street change, there's only one neighbour still here from when I moved in.</p><p>"I even remember the first car being bought in the street. I don't believe the council have the authority to evict me."</p><p>The court heard how Mr May, a retired merchant seaman, has no access to mains electricity or gas and has been powering his home using car batteries charged up with a petrol generator.</p><p>He added: "The council claims my electric system is dangerous, but it's a car battery. It's just as dangerous as a car being parked in the street.</p><p>"None of the neighbours have complained. There's not one person I don't get along with in the street.</p><p>"I'm friends with everyone. I get milk for my 90-year-old neighbour and buy her papers every Sunday.</p><h2>FINAL WARNING</h2><p>"They know they can come to me and I'll help them. They don't think my home is a threat."</p><p>Neighbour Eileen March, a 70-year-old bus driver,&nbsp;said: "He's a good neighbour, if you need any help he'll do it.</p><p>"He carries my shopping bags in, he took the lid of my paint when I was decorating and took the skirting board off.</p><p>"Where are you going to get neighbours like that? It's unfair, that was his mum's house and he's lived there all his life.</p><p>"They're just picking on him. I will be devastated if he goes."</p><p>District Judge Charnock-Neal made the possession order, saying that it wasn’t in breach of human rights legislation and that housing law allows for eviction of tenants that allow properties to deteriorate.</p><p>She said: “Storing fuel including petrol and Calor gas could cause danger. He failed to keep his home neat, tidy and clean, evidenced from the photo I have seen from 2018-2021.</p><p>“He failed to dispose of rubbish left in his shed, lean to, and garden. In contrast to the claimant the defendant offered limited evidence.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“His reason for not offering entry to the property was his age. He offered no medical evidence that he was shielding. The Government stated high-risk ages were over 70.”</p><p>Mr May was told he has 28 days to vacate the property, however, if he can show evidence that he has cleaned it up he can apply at court for eviction proceedings to be halted.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/66b5d03b-8834-4599-b59d-13989579cf02.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000683843171.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Family of eight on brink of homelessness with council house set to be DEMOLISHED following eviction notice</span><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The Sun news desk?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZoN0fJNsaGpnn5a9brfInKKenF2YvLa6wqKjZqCfqsCmecaaqZ2dnmLEor%2FTnmY%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./suzanne-somers-young-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Photos of Pop Icon &amp;amp; Actress  Hollywood Life">&larr;
