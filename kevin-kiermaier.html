He played against the Texas Rangers and the Cleveland Indians, leading <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Baseball America</a> to name Kevin as the tenth-best prospect in the Rays’ Minor League system.</span></p><p>Also read <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Charlie Morton Age, Stats, Contract, Rays, Injury, Married, Wife, Net Worth</a>.</strong></p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>2014-2015</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Kevin hit his first major league home run against Mike Morin on May 18, 2014. At the end of the 2014 season, he was one of the finalists for the Gold Glove Award, finishing 108 games in total.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Subsequently, in 2015, Kiermaier led all the MLB outfielders by reaching 100 MPH nine times, whereas all the others combined reached the same speed 27 times.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Not to mention, Kiermaier finished the 2015 season with 42 saved defensive runs.

Unfortunately, on May 21, he fractured two bones in his left hand during a match against Detroit Tigers.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>However, Kevin resumed his limited workouts on May 27 after surgery.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>As luck would have it, Kiermaier was still one of the best defenders in all of baseball despite missing a considerable amount of time.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In addition to that, Kiermaier finished the 2016 season with 105 games and received the Gold Glove Award for the second time.</span></p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">David Ortiz Net Worth, Age, Height, Stats, Wife, Jersey, Hall of Fame, Instagram</a>.</strong></p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>2017-2018</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>After the end of the 2016 season, Kiermaier signed an extended six-year contract with the Tampa Bay Rays.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>But sadly, Kiermaier suffered from a hairline fracture in his right hip and had to sit out for at least two months.

He was in second place in the Defensive Runs Saved at center field with 22, which was his lowest number of saves.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Considering his time off because of his injury, Kiermaier did not make it one of the finalists for the Gold Glove Award for the first time as he did not reach the innings requirement.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Shortly after Kiermaier was recovering from his hip injury, he tore a ligament in his right thumb while sliding.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Unlikely, he finished the season with only 88 games, but he received the Wilson Defensive Player of the Year award despite his injuries.</span></p><p><strong>Also read <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mallex Smith Age, Stats, Contract, Trade, News, MLB, Net Worth, Girlfriend</a>.</strong></p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>2019-2020</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>After the challenging seasons, in 2019, Kiermaier won his third Gold Glove Award.

However, he returned for game seven, and the Rays advanced to the World Series.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>To top that off, Kiermaier hit a home run against Clayton Kershaw of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 2020 World Series. Tampa Bay finished the season with the best record in American League.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>But unlike the other season, he did not make it to the finalists for the Gold Glove Award, even though he had given his best.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“I feel like what I did out there, defensively, was under-appreciated this year.” Kiermaier said in an interview with ESPN.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Having said that, fans from around the world still love Kiermaier, regardless of the final result.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Kevin Kiermaier | Injuries</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Below you will find the list of injuries faced by Kevin Kiermaier.
