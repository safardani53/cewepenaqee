Former member of the disputed KwaSizabantu Mission in KwaZulu-Natal, Bothma emerged as one of the brave former members who testified against the mission’s human rights crimes.</p><p>Bothma testified in 2020 before the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious, and Linguistic Communities about her childhood sexual and physical abuse. She described being forced to “suck on the breasts” of Erlo Stegen’s daughters, Ruth Combrink and Elizabeth Vermaak.</p><p>Bothma came to popularity as a white-skinned Zulu woman after appearing in a TV advertisement speaking in isiZulu, which left tongues wagging. The lovely blonde stunner has now landed a role in one of South Africa’s most famous soapies. She even spoke during former President Jacob Zuma’s inauguration. The bilingual, whose native language is Afrikaans, was fluent in 13 languages, including many South African languages and German. Let us learn more about Marietjie Bothma’s husband.</p><h2>Marietjie Bothma Husband: Was the Isizulu-Fluent Presenter Married?</h2><p><strong>People are curious about Marietjie Bothma’s marriage</strong>. Marietjie Bothma, often known as Kasi Mlungu, has found yet another reason to love the Kasi way of life. She told the Daily Sun that she had found love and that black guys are the best because they are kind and know how to treat women.&nbsp;She added that after leaving an abusive mlungu in 2013, she told herself that she would never date another white guy again.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Marietjie-Bothma-1.jpg alt="Marietjie Bothma" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>When Marietjie recently disclosed her new partner to the SunTeam, it turned out to be a TV fan. One of them was Ashby Barden, who participated in Mzansi Magic’s Date My Family last year. The couple, who reside in Alexandra, Johannesburg, just became engaged. When Marietjie met Ashby a year ago, she said she knew she’d found the man of her dreams. However, the two sometimes have disagreements. Mlungus, according to Marietjie, questioned why she was seeing a black person and black women often accused her of stealing their man.</p><p>According to the Daily Sun, Ashby’s heart melted on their first date. “It did feel strange because she spoke Zulu while her skin was white and her eyes were blue,” Ashby said.&nbsp;He added that he had always wished for a white woman since he believed they were honest, kind, and caring.</p><h2>Marietjie Bothma’s Family</h2><p>Bothma is survived by her daughter Klariez and son Brandon, who are “very heartbroken” by their mother’s death.&nbsp;Bothma recalled her childhood misery of being punished for speaking out about the abuse, including the use of pepper water.&nbsp;While the mission had ignored abuse allegations, attributing them to individuals rather than the mission, Bothma’s testimony shed light on the systemic nature of the torment she endured at home and at the mission’s school.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Marietjie-Bothma-2.jpg alt="Marietjie Bothma" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Despite the mission’s claims that it was resolving the issue by fleeing, she bravely reported her adoptive father’s sexual abuse.&nbsp;Marietjie Bothma, a radio broadcaster, and actress, went from her home in Thembisa to her close friend Thabang Mochela’s home in the Vaal to “rest” two weeks ago. They had no clue their last days would be spent together. Bothma, also known as Intombi Yomzulu, died on Monday in Vereeniging’s Kopanong Hospital after a short illness. She was 40 years old.&nbsp;She gained popularity after appearing in a pie ad speaking Zulu and starring in some of Mzansi’s most famous soapies. She also spoke at former President Jacob Zuma’s inauguration.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Marietjie Bothma</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Marietjie Bothma Husband</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGikmqqZmsGrtcRmmaismKKubrTUrJmappRixKK%2FjKyfnmWdlr%2BztcSdZLChm556orrDZp2apZmhxm6wxK2YoqSjZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./erin-cahills-husband-list.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Erin Cahill Dating  Erin Cahill's Husband &amp;amp; Exes">&larr;
