opting to get rid of both the mustache and <a href=#>white nail polish</a>.</p><p>"Greg f**king stubs his toe and [he] ruins [everything]," Tom can be heard telling Schwartz over two bottles of beer.</p><p>The video showed two cameras in the room - one facing each of the reality stars as they seemingly talked business in regard to their Franklin Village bar, <a href=#>Schwartz & Sandy's</a>.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>The two opened the bar/lounge with co-owner and restauranteur Greg Morris last fall.</p><p>During season 10, both Toms were often seen disagreeing with Greg in terms of when the bar would be ready to open.</p><p>While it's been a few months, it seems as if Tom may still have some issues with Greg's business tactics.</p><p>Following the video, a photo was also shared that showed Tom clearly frustrated as he looked at the ground with his arms crossed in front of him.</p><p>"Boots on the ground for Tom v Tom fighting about their bar," the Instagram user wrote alongside the photo.</p><p>While Tom is now filming, he <a href=#>skipped out on the first few days</a> of shooting in order to participate in another TV show.</p><p>The former SUR bartender was missing last Wednesday when the&nbsp;Bravo&nbsp;series started filming the new season.</p><p>Per&nbsp;<a href=#>TMZ</a>, Tom had been out shooting the second season of Fox's&nbsp;<a href=#>Special Forces: World's Toughest Test</a> in&nbsp;<a href=#>New Zealand</a>.</p><p>Season 1 of the competition show aired earlier this year, with multiple celebrities being put to the test in harsh conditions to see who can complete the hard survival tasks.</p><p>While he wasn't there at the start, fans knew Tom would continue filming VPR after returning from New Zealand.</p><p>After the fallout of Scandoval, Tom spent the spring touring around the US with his band,&nbsp;<a href=#>Tom Sandoval & The Most Extras</a>.</p><p>Recently, the band informed fans they would be&nbsp;<a href=#>taking a months-long hiatus</a>&nbsp;and had to reschedule an upcoming show.</p><p>In an email sent to would-be attendees, the band said it was pushing the show back to September 30, writing that at that time "series taping will be complete."</p><p>While most of the cast has signed back on to film for season 11, one important cast member will not be returning.</p><h2>WHO'S RETURNING?</h2><p>All cast members have agreed to film for season 11 - except for&nbsp;Raquel, as reported by&nbsp;<a href=#>TMZ</a>.</p><p>Despite the cheating scandal, Ariana has signed on to film the new season, which will undoubtfully cover the opening of the sandwich shop she owns with <a href=#>Katie Maloney</a>.</p><p>As for Raquel, the former beauty queen checked<a href=#>&nbsp;into a mental health facility</a>&nbsp;roughly two months ago following the filming of the season 10 reunion at the end of March.</p><p>According to production, Raquel's team has been working hard to get her back on the show for the new season.</p><p>However, she is currently still at the facility and has been making her mental health a priority as she continues her social media hiatus.</p><h2>END OF SEASON 10</h2><p>At the very end of the season 10 reunion, Raquel made a shocking confession about the timeline of her affair with Tom.</p><p><a href=#>It was revealed</a>&nbsp;that six days after the reunion was filmed in March, as the cast sat down to do their final confessionals, Raquel decided to come clean about the timeline of her affair.</p><p>Raquel confirmed several of the lies that&nbsp;Tom said about their&nbsp;affair&nbsp;after being interrogated by her co-stars, including their "one-night stand" in early August, six days after the reunion was taped.</p><p>She admitted that she and Tom had hooked up multiple times during&nbsp;<a href=#>Scheana Shay</a>'s wedding in August.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Raquel also admitted to hooking up with Tom in his shared house with&nbsp;Ariana&nbsp;while she was away for her grandmother's funeral, despite his furious denial during the reunion taping prior to her one-on-one interview.</p><p>“I love Ariana as a person and then also I’m in love with Tom Sandoval, so yeah it didn’t seem that far-fetched of an idea, but it was not something in question. God, he’s gonna kill me I just hate lying so much,” Raquel said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/vanderpump-rules-disgraced-tom-sandoval-830217469.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/NINTCHDBPICT000823372815.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/raquel-leviss-tom-sandoval-ariana-827859408-2.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwZWmFeISYaK2appSav7HBzKlkq62cmsBuwM6mZKyZnpm8t63LZqqlmZ2oerSvx7CYq6yqYrumw4ysnJqrn6N8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-tommy-ford-martin-life-support-hospital.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Tommy Ford?  5 Things To Know About The Actor On Life Support  Hollywood Life">&larr;
