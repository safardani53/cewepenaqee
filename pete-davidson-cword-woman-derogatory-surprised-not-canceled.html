He's already notoriously <a href=#>difficult to work with</a>, but using that word… that's not nice, you cannot call a woman that.</p><p>"That is called being canceled."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More Pete Davidson">Read More Pete Davidson</h2><p>The insider continued: "It's not something you'd expect someone to say who respects women, and certainly not a guy who dates some of the hottest women in Hollywood."</p><p>"Despite being raised by a mother- he seems to have a lot of anger towards women.&nbsp;</p><p>"Using the c-word is so disgusting and so disrespectful," the insider added.</p><p>"When PETA throws a fit and calls you out on something, you just ignore it, they can't do anything to you- exploding on them does nothing for anyone.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>"But then you continue to use that word publicly to <a href=#>refer to a woman in your audience</a>, there seems to be no limit to who you feel you can hurl that at," the insider said.</p><h2>THE LATEST INCIDENT</h2><p>Last month, the funnyman got into it with a woman in the audience at his show at the Wind Creek Event Center in Bethlehem, <a href=#>Pennsylvania</a>.</p><p>A U.S. Sun reporter attended a show headlined by Pete, along with fellow comedians <a href=#>Jon Stewart</a> and <a href=#>John Mulaney</a>.</p><p>The trio came out at the end of the show to take questions from the audience when a woman shouted out that Pete was a "racist."&nbsp;</p><p>John tried to defend the comedian, explaining it was all just part of Pete's act.</p><p>Instead of brushing off the accusation, it seemed to enrage the <a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a> alum, who hurled the slur at the woman telling her: "You’re a c**t. Sit the f**k down!"</p><p>As the shocked audience looked on, John tried making light of the moment by joking: "Clean up in aisle 3!"</p><p>Eyewitnesses said that Pete's alleged "racism" came during a bit relating to the antiquated terms that delineate bedrooms in a home.</p><p>"He was talking about his realtor, who is Black," the insider continued.&nbsp;</p><p>"And he said the realtor was showing him homes, and he called the big room the 'master bedroom'"</p><p>"Pete did a skit about himself being 'the master,' before he was corrected by the realtor, who told him that the term is now 'primary bedroom' because 'master' was named after a master in slavery."</p><p>It was unclear what part of the joke the woman objected to.</p><h2>UNHINGED VOICEMAIL&nbsp;</h2><p>In June, Pete was accused of using the slur in a voicemail he left for a spokesperson at PETA after the organization expressed their displeasure that the comedian was spotted shopping for a dog instead of adopting a pet.&nbsp;</p><p>PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) wasn't pleased with <a href=#>Pete</a>'s choice to purchase a pup instead of adopting one at a dog rescue over the summer.</p><p>They had issued a statement to <a href=#>TMZ</a> expressing their disappointment in the comedian's choice.</p><p>It read: "It's tragic that Pete didn’t seek out a borough-born mutt from a city animal shelter, because a scrappy New Yorker with charm, personality, and unconventional handsomeness could have been his perfect match."</p><p>But Pete quickly fired back with an expletive-filled<a href=#> voice message</a> to the organization's Senior VP of Cruelty Investigations, Daphna Nachminovitch, to defend his decision.</p><p>In the voicemail, the comic claimed that he's allergic to dogs, which is why he purchased a Cavapoo - known for being a hypoallergenic breed that doesn't shed.</p><p>He also noted during the rant that the pet was for his mother, who recently lost her puppy companion.</p><p>Pete then proceeded to slam the PETA rep for not doing her research before talking to the media, cursed at her, called her a c-word and made a comment about his genitals.</p><h2>'SORRY, NOT SORRY'</h2><p>After the incident, Pete said that he was sorry for his choice of words, but he wasn't sorry he left the voicemail.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"I haven't seen my mom and sister cry like that in over 20 years. I was trying to cheer up my family. I was already upset that the store had filmed me without my permission or acknowledgment," he said.</p><p>Pete continued: "Then this organization (PETA) made a public example of us, making our grieving situation worse. I am upset. It was a poor choice of words. I shouldn't have said what I said, but I am not sorry for standing up for myself and my family."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/NINTCHDBPICT000755467022.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/pete-davidson-pictured-filming-bupkis-769162032-1.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxYm6Ad4WWaKeerJVisaLCyJ2qqKZdmMSwvsNmrqilkaN6pbHRqJ6arJ%2Bnxm6%2F1Kunq6GjmrFuus6tZJyZnpiyrbHDaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./pussycat-dolls-photos-group-pics.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Photos Of The Group  Hollywood Life">&larr;
