Ciaran Keating, the renowned Irish musician Ronan Keating’s brother, was killed in a horrific vehicle accident while on his way to see his kid play football.</p><p>Ciaran, who had previously worked as a car salesman and operated a pub, did not have the same amount of fame as his brother Ronan. Ronan, for example, is a well-known musician, singer, and songwriter who came to prominence as the main vocalist of the successful boy band Boyzone.&nbsp;Following the group’s initial success, Ronan pursued a solo career and released a number of successful albums, displaying his versatility as an artist. His solo singles include “When You Say Nothing at All” and “Life is a Rollercoaster,” both of which received worldwide praise and cemented his standing as a solo performer.</p><p>Ronan’s sincere remarks were extended at the tragic demise of his beloved sibling, and he must be having a difficult time comprehending this news. Let us look at the facts of the tragedy and the condolences expressed in remembrance of Ciaran Keating.</p><h2>Ronan Keating’s Ciaran Keating Accident and Obituary</h2><p><strong>Ciaran Keating</strong>, the elder brother of musician Ronan Keating, was killed in a vehicle accident.&nbsp;Following the terrible tragedy, Ronan is said to have rushed to Ireland to be with his family.&nbsp;Ronan is the youngest of five children, with one sister, Linda, and three brothers, Ciarán, Gerard, and Gary. Their father was a truck driver, while their mother was a hairdresser. Ronan is the most well-known of his siblings.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Ciaran-Keating-1.jpg alt="Ciaran Keating" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Cork City FC issued a statement offering their heartfelt condolences on the death of Ciaran Keating, father of club player Ruair Keating.&nbsp;They offered their sincere condolences to Ruair and the whole Keating family at this very difficult time.&nbsp;The League of Ireland sent their sympathies to the Keating family, expressing profound regret over Ruair Keating’s father’s untimely death.&nbsp;Councillor John O’Malley also expressed his grief and dismay at the awful news. He underscored Ciaran’s great esteem among those who knew him and conveyed condolences to his wife, children, and extended relatives.&nbsp;The family’s privacy was sought in the death announcement, and funeral arrangements will be determined later.</p><h2>Is Ciaran Keating’s Accident Related To His Death?</h2><p>Yes, Ciaran Keating died as a result of an accident, as he was killed in a vehicle collision while going with his wife to see their kid play football.&nbsp;Ciaran, who was in his 50s and from Louisburgh, Ireland, was on his way to see his son Ruair, 27, play for Cork City versus Sligo Rovers in the Irish Premier League.&nbsp;Around 3:35 p.m., the accident happened on the N5 near Swinford, Co Mayo, a recognized accident-prone region. Ciaran and his wife Ann Marie’s automobile collided with another vehicle, resulting in Ciaran’s death.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Ciaran-Keating.jpg alt="Ciaran Keating" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>According to reports, the driver of the second car is being treated for severe injuries. Ann Marie, a secondary school teacher, was treated at Mayo University Hospital for non-life-threatening injuries.&nbsp;Ruair, who began for Cork against Sligo Rovers, was replaced at halftime. This unfortunate occurrence occurred just a few days before Ruair’s 28th birthday.&nbsp;Ruair has previously played for Irish clubs Sligo Rovers and Galway United, as well as English club Torquay United.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiaopmilrtut8Saq6Kml2K8o7XTrpirsV2dvLh5w6KbZqCVYrGqsYycmK6rlWK8p3nDnpitoF2Wu6V5wJyaopyVo8FusMStmKKko2Q%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./north-west-pink-hair-tiktok-kim-kardashian.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="North West, 9, shows off her new pink hair and dance moves in TikTok without famous mom Kim Kardashi">&larr;
