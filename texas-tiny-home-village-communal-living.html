My vision is not for people to look at [Mustard Seed] as a house, but as a home."</p><p>He concluded: "I think a lot of times when we look at apartment complexes, people build them as high and as close together as they can so they can capitalize on every single dollar.</p><p>"Here, it wasn’t about that. It was about giving people space and having their own walls."</p><p>The Mustard Seed Village rental price seems to be a great deal as <a href=#>RentCafe.com</a> states the average renting price in Austin, Texas, to be $1,806.</p><p>Therefore, anyone living in the tiny home community founded by Claypool is spending approximately $400 less a month than people in similar living situations in the nearby area.</p><p>Claypool and his wife's affordable home community wouldn't have been possible without the help of Rene Flores, a Place 2 Round Rock City Council member and loan officer with Amplify Credit Union.</p><p>Flores shares the same concern regarding housing affordability in Texas.</p><p>Flores told Community Impact: "We do as much as we can as a city, but I believe it’s very much [up to] private development to fill that gap. We rely on builders and developers to have an eye and a heart to do that.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"One of [Amplify’s] thoughts is that we can do something toward affordable housing.</p><p>"I don’t know that we think we can solve all of Central Texas’s issues, but if you can help one project at a time, that’s better than nothing."</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Where to buy a tiny home</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>THE tiny home phenomenon found new heights as an alternative living solution for consumers concerned with ballooning homebuying costs and sustainability concerns.</p><p>*If you click on a link in this boxout, we may earn affiliate revenue.</p><p>You can buy 'tiny homes' online in a few places, including:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/need-communal-living-taken-without-851486403.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/need-communal-living-taken-without-851486402.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zKilnrFfbn96gZVyaWisla2utHnToqWyZZikuqZ51aKjpZmXmnqku8ymrKeZnGK5qsLIp55o</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./vet-expert-christmas-tree-water-not-safe-for-pets-tips.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Vet Expert Says it Is 'Not Safe' for Pets to Drink Christmas Tree Water">&larr;
