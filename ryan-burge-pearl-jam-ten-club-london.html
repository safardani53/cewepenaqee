stepping away from Newport in 2014, the Cheltenham-born midfielder decided to take almost two years off.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ryan-burge_-1st-image_.jpg><p><a href=#>His decision was inspired</a> by wanting to give his body a rest after a series of cruel injuries had hindered his progress.</p><p>But during his hiatus, ambitious Burge, 25, discovered something else.</p><p>In 2016, he set up Ten Club London, originally as <a href=#>a clothing brand for men</a> and women, to curb his boredom as he plotted what he wanted to do next with his life.</p><p>The fashion label ended up becoming a success and soon other footballers, Love Island contestants and Geordie Shore stars were seen wearing his clobber.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000406945601.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000406942238.jpg><p>However, last month his success story took another exciting twist when he received a call from lawyers representing the 90s grunge group from Seattle.</p><p>They were keen on buying the naming rights to Burge's website and wanted to negotiate a deal.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">latest football features</h2></p><p>Burge and the rockers negotiated a package that has given the former Port Vale star a financial platform to build his brand.</p><p>Pearl Jam's seminal album is called 'Ten' and their fans' group are called Ten Club.</p><p>That's why they were inspired to deal with Burge, he explained.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000045878425.jpg> <img

album called 'Ten' and their lawyers contacted me through an email.</p><p>"A rep of theirs said they liked the name, they found my website and said they've got a fan club called Ten Club, so it would be of massive interest to them.</p><h3><a href=#><span>THE BLING RING</span> <span>Football’s biggest jeweller: Introducing MJJ Exclusive, who deliver bespoke luxury items for the likes of Bellerin, Firmino and Alli</span></a></h3><p>"They actually have a massive fan base in London, I know that because their lawyer was telling me he was a Pearl Jam fan and he couldn't get a ticket for a sold out show at The O2 Arena.</p><p>"They didn't tell me much, but said they wanted to do something in London and were interested in acquiring the name."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000406948481.jpg> <img

Ryan admitted he was a bit reluctant.</p><p>In the end, he decided it was for the best and would allow him the freedom to change his company's focus.</p><p>"To start with, I said I wasn't interested in selling it," he confessed.</p><p>"Then, the more I thought about it, people could get the wrong idea and think I was just a nightclub.</p><p>"Instead, maybe calling it Ten London sounded a bit cleaner.</p><p>"So I said to them I was willing to sell Ten Club London, if they'd let me register the trademark of Ten London, which they said was fine.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000406945966.jpg><p>Burge revealed he didn't get a chance to deal with singer Eddie Vedder and Co. personally.</p><p>However, his younger brother had heard of the band and told Burge how big they were.</p><p>"My younger brother knew of them, so I realised they were quite a big deal when they contacted me," he admitted.</p><p>Burge remained coy on the figure he received from the corporate conglomerate, but said he got a very good deal.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000406942257.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000406943681.jpg><p>"I asked for more to start with," he told us.</p><p>"I thought their valuation was very low to start with, so I went in high. Then we met somewhere in the middle.</p><p>"But I think it was fair. Could I have got more? Probably.</p><p>"However, I was happy to go along with the deal."</p><p>And being interested in business and making money is exactly what got Ryan into launching his company in the first place.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000045878437.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000406942255.jpg><p>"Even when I was a young kid playing football, I've always been interested in turning a pound into two pounds.</p><p>"I enjoyed the idea of being a salesman. I used to sell bits here and there for friends, <a href=#>things like designer clothes</a>.</p><p>"I was at a mate's house one night and just thought I should do something and the name Ten Club London just hit me.</p><p>"I didn't sit down and say I wanted to start a clothing brand, which I think a lot of people do and then come up with the name.</p><p>"I sat down, drew the logo I thought would work and contacted a graphic designer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000406946075.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000406942254.jpg><p>"I had it clear in my mind what I wanted it to look like and I showed my teammates and family members and they said it looked great."</p><p>Stumbling upon the idea of Ten Club London, Burge realised that he soon needed a website to sell his clothes.</p><p>He also had to get a basic understanding of <a href=#>how the fashion industry worked</a>.</p><p>"I didn't know anything about websites.</p><p>"It was completely a foreign language to me, so I contacted a web designer, I put a message on my LinkedIn and asked anyone I knew for contacts.</p><p>"I knew absolutely nothing about running a business, all I ever knew was playing football.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000406942724.jpg><p>"Through LinkedIn, I found a contact from someone who worked in the clothing industry.</p><p>"I networked, went to a few meetings and gradually found out more about the industry itself.</p><p>"I found out what were good materials, what weren't, where to source them and built some great contacts."</p><p>Ten Club London<a href=#> enjoyed success in the celebrity market too</a>, kitting out stars including James Tindale from Geordie Shore and Scott Thomas from Love Island.</p><p>Burge revealed: "It's really good to get that celebrity support. It really helps put us on the map as a fashion brand."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000406945481.jpg><p>And now, the entrepreneur wants to take his business one step further. By re-branding it as Ten London he feels he can broaden his horizons.</p><p>A regular on the club circuit, Burge wants to create a new website that is the go-to site for London-bound tourists looking for a place to stay and a nightclub to be seen at.</p><p>"Ten Club London was originally a clothing brand, but I'm living in London so I started going out more," he said.</p><p>"You're not able to do that when you play football, you have to be in a hotel or somewhere getting some rest.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000406943679.jpg><p>"But I'd go out and mingle, meet contacts and I just had this idea.</p><p>"If you are new to London, you don't know where to start in terms of going out.</p><p></p><p>"There isn't anything that puts it all in one place. Like say, if you're visiting for a weekend and you want to know what the best hotels, clubs and restaurants are.</p><p>"I wanted to bring together the best of London, while selling high-quality fashion too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000406942731.jpg><p>"Through my new site, you'll be able to book hotels, go to the best clubs and buy from the clothing label.</p><p>"My plan is I want it to be the go-to brand for the best of London, so someone who visits knows to come to us to map out their experience in the capital.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">most read in football</h2></p><p>"Ten London is a high-end brand, so it won’t be affordable for everyone.</p><p>"We’re only working with the best services the city has to offer, so it will be five-star hotels, restaurants and the best clubs."</p><p>But what does the future hold for Burge's football career?</p><p>He did make a brief return to Eastleigh in the National League in 2017, however he is in two minds on a comeback.</p><p>"I’m undecided if I want to return to the game," he said.</p><p>"I’ve played 98 games and I’ve got a very good record over that period. I achieved promotion and Player of the Year at Port Vale.</p><p>"After only half a season in the football league, I also had strong interest from Premier League and Championship clubs.</p><p>"I keep myself fit, and if I returned, it wouldn’t take me long to generate that kind of interest again”</p><p><strong>To follow Burge's fashion label, <a href=#>visit his Instagram</a>.
