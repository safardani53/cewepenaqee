Interestingly, Bijou also has a history of alleged abuse from her time working in Hollywood. Here’s everything you need to know about Bijou and her marriage to Danny.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/bijou-phillips-danny-mastersons-wife-ss-embed.jpg><h2>Bijou has two famous parents</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Bijou is the daughter of musician <strong>John Phillips</strong> and actress/singer/model <strong>Genevieve Waite</strong>. John was the lead vocalist of the <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Mamas & the Papas</strong></a>. He died in March 2001. Genevieve was from South Africa and played the title character in the 1968 film&nbsp;Joanna. She died in May 2019.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Bijou was named after the song “My Petite Bijou” by Lambert, Hendricks, & Ross. Her parents split up when she was young and ended up foster care since John and Genevieve were found to be unfit to care for her. John eventually won custody of Bijou when she was in third grade and she moved in with him in Long Island.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Bijou has one brother,&nbsp;<strong>Tamerlane Phillips</strong>. She has three half-siblings, <strong>Mackenzie Phillips</strong>, 62, <strong>Jeffrey Phillips</strong>, and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Chynna Phillips</strong></a>, 54. Mackenzie and Jeffrey are John’s children from his first marriage to <strong>Susan Adams</strong>. Chynna is John’s daughter from his second marriage to <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Michelle Phillips</strong></a>. Chynna is a member of the <strong>Wilson Phillips</strong> pop group with <strong>Carnie Wilson</strong> and <strong>Wendy Wilson</strong>.</p><h2>She’s a musician and actress</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Bijou followed in her parents’ footsteps and pursued a career in Hollywood. She released her debut studio album&nbsp;I’d Rather Eat Glass&nbsp;in 1999. She’s appeared in films like&nbsp;<i>Almost&nbsp;Famous, The Door in the Floor, Hostel: Part II,</i> and<i> Choke</i>. Her most notable television gig was a recurring role in the Fox sitcom&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Raising Hope</a>&nbsp;from 2010 to 2013. Bijou did modeling for Calvin Klein and other advertising campaigns before she pursued acting and singing full-time.</p><h2>She’s been accused of abuse</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Bijou was accused of shaming and assaulting&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Mean Girls</a>&nbsp;actor <strong>Daniel Franzese</strong> on the set of Bully in November 2017. Daniel claimed in a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Facebook post</a> that Bijou “body shamed” him and “ridiculed” the actor for being gay. He also alleged that Bijou “physically assaulted” him on set by twisting his nipple and kicking him in the back of the head. Bijou apologized for her actions in a statement to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a>. “<span>I was a teenager and reckless in my behavior. I know Daniel to be a trustworthy and honest person, and to find out through social media that I was not the friend I thought I was to him made me so sad,”&nbsp;</span>she<span>&nbsp;said.&nbsp;</span><span>“I am so mortified by this behavior and have contacted Daniel and apologized to him privately. I am not and never have been homophobic. I have nothing but love for the LGBTQ community and Daniel.”&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;Daniel accepted Bijou’s apology on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Twitter</a> and said he forgives her “because I don’t know her private story either.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Also in Nov. 2017,&nbsp;<i>The Princess&nbsp;Diaries&nbsp;</i>actress <strong>Heather Matarazzo&nbsp;</strong>told Daniel on a podcast that she was also allegedly physically attacked by Bijou before they began filming&nbsp;Hostel: Part II. Heather reportedly claimed that Bijou threw her against the wall and then “choked” her for almost 20 seconds, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>reports</a> at the time. Heather referred to the alleged incident as one of the most “horrifying moments” in her life.</p><h2>Bijou and Danny started dating in 2004.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Bijou and Danny met at a poker tournament in Las Vegas in 2004. While dating, they starred in two movies together in 2009,&nbsp;Made for Each Other&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Bridge to Nowhere. They also shared the screen on an episode of Raising Hope. Bijou and Danny&nbsp;got engaged in March 2011 after seven years of dating.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/bijou-phillips-danny-mastersons-wife-ss-embed1.jpg><h2>They got married and have one daughter</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>Bijou and Danny tied the knot on October 18, 2011 at a private castle in Ireland. They said “I do” in front of family and friends including Danny’s brother&nbsp;<strong>Chris Masterson&nbsp;</strong>who was the best man, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>. Bijou reportedly wore a custom Zac Posen gown on her wedding day. Less than three years later, Bijou gave birth to the couple’s first child, daughter <strong>Fiona,</strong>&nbsp;on Feb. 14, 2014. They announced the news on<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Instagram</a> at the time, with Danny sharing a photo of his baby girl sleeping on his stomach.&nbsp;“Hello friends. Beyond thrilled to announce the birth of our daughter Fianna Francis Masterson!” The Ranch&nbsp;star wrote in his caption.&nbsp;“Mom and baby are doing amazing. You can all refer to me as dj dadpants from now on.”</p><h2>Bijou stood by Danny amidst rape allegations but then filed for divorce</h2><p id=content-paragraph-14>Bijou had defended Danny ever since he was accused of raping three different women. He denied all the allegations, but was found guilty of raping two of the women in May 2023. “Obviously, Mr. Masterson and his wife are in complete shock considering that these nearly 20-year-old allegations are suddenly resulting in charges being filed, but they and their family are comforted knowing that ultimately the truth will come out,” Danny’s attorney <strong>Thomas Mesereau</strong>&nbsp;said in a statement to&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife</strong> in June 2020. At the time, Bijou deleted her IG account on June 17, 2020 following the D.A.’s charges against her husband. She then revived her account but had comments limited and only posted a now deleted photo of <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Danny in Nov. 2022</a> — just after the mistrial</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>Danny is a Scientologist, as are the three rape accusers, so the Church of Scientology played a role in both trials. The three women all accused Danny of rape in separate incidents that all allegedly occurred in the early 2000s.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>During her husband’s September 2023 sentencing, Bijou was seen crying in the courtroom, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Messenger</a>. The judge denied Danny’s request for a new trial, and his three victims all read impact statements before the jury.</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>On Sept. 19, it was reported that Bijou filed for divorce from Danny the day before. Bijou’s lawyer,&nbsp;<strong>Peter A. Lauzon</strong>, released the following statement to TMZ: “Ms. Phillips has decided to file for divorce from her husband during this unfortunate time. Her priority remains with her daughter,” the statement began. “This period has been unimaginably hard on <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the marriage</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the family</a>. Mr. Masterson was always present for Ms. Phillips during her most difficult times of her life. Ms. Phillips acknowledges that Mr. Masterson is a wonderful father to their daughter.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>The documents obtained by the outlet&nbsp;revealed that Bijou listed the date of their separation as “TBD” and cited the standard “irreconcilable differences” as the reason for the split. She is reportedly asking her estranged husband to pay for spousal support and attorneys fees. Additionally, Bijou is requesting that her legal last name be restored to Phillips. She has also requested to obtain “legal and physical custody” of their daughter but will reportedly “allow visitation for Danny.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8OapaexXaKutMDEq6qopl2stqexjJugo6elYr2ptculoKmrXWmFd4GTamxo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./abdullah-saeed-fawaz-al-kubaisi.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fame | Abdullah Saeed Fawaz Al-Kubaisi net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024">&larr;
