It came back on, then went off again. It's freezing. You can see your own breath in the candlelight."</p><p>While Alan Walker said: "People are expecting the gas to be put back on any time. In reality I think this is going to go on for a long time.</p><p>"And with the cold weather, it's warmer to stay outside than it is to stay in the house."</p><p>Mr Walker said he feared there would be further issues once the water had been removed from the system.</p><p>"I've had customers in here saying they're turning their gas hobs on and there's water coming out," he said.</p><p>In the House of Commons, Sheffield Hallam Labour MP Olivia Blake said she was "yet to receive a response" to her letter to ministers asking for help with the incident.</p><p>She told MPs: "I am very conscious that the council don't just need money, they need resources now. There are parts that are needed for boilers to do the repairs, there are meters that need to be replaced.</p><p>"This is a huge effort, this has resulted in water flowing out of people's ovens, flowing out of people's fires, flowing out of their boilers which should be sealed, and getting past the water meters.</p><p>"This is an unprecedented and novel - it has been described to me - incident which really needs some support and action to make sure that we have the right infrastructure on the ground and I don't think it can be left to the local authorities to organise that."</p><p>Deputy Commons Speaker Nigel Evans agreed the incident was "appalling" but said he had not been notified of a statement from the Government about it.</p><p>Yorkshire Water said the leak had since been fixed although the draining of water is still ongoing.</p><p>Chilly conditions are expected to turn even colder across much of the UK later today and through to Thursday as air from the Arctic spreads south across the country.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Frosty nights are expected, with sub-zero temperatures and widespread frosts which could be severe in some areas.</p><p>Forecasters warn today wintry showers will affect northern Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales and eastern&nbsp;<a href=#>England</a>, with snow settling on hills in the north.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/a969-cock-bridge-tomintoul-road-781309069.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/NINTCHDBPICT000781299610.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2022-sheffield-uk-hundreds-properties-781041622.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ313g5hvaGxnpJ28tr%2FAp5usZaeewam71K1koZ2Rqbavs4yfoK%2BdXZmuur%2BMppijp6Jitq%2BvyJ2cp6xf</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./worst-nipple-tattoos-pictures-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Worst ever nipple tattoos revealed in bizarre gallery showing how people have made grenades, eyeball">&larr;
