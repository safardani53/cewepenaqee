Crowley has appeared in films such as Never Back Down, The Artist as a Young Man: A Portrait of Cameron Fairchild, and Burn Notice.&nbsp;He also has a YouTube channel named Steven and Jason, which has over 14K followers. Crowley recently made headlines after discussing Amber Heard’s pending defamation battle against Johnny Depp.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Steven-Crowley-2.jpg alt="Steven Crowley" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Crowley said to YouTuber Andy Signore that Heard ultimately disliked him once they began filming. Nonetheless, following their second week of filming, the two became friends.&nbsp;Crowley claimed Amber Heard was dating Tasya Van Ree while shooting Never Back Down, but the couple was not seen together in public. When Ree visited the set of the film, Heard presented her as her closest friend, according to the actor:</p><p>“She [Heard] was dating Tasya when we were shooting, but she was closeted at the time and attempted to disguise it, which wasn’t very successful since Tasya showed up on set with Amber’s name tattooed on her.” She’s [Heard] saying, ‘that’s my best buddy,’ and ‘I’m like, dunno how many best friends have their best friend’s name tattooed on their body.'”</p><p>Crowley then said that Heard ultimately confirmed her connection with Ree and announced their engagement:</p><p>“After the second week, she told me, ‘I have to tell you about Tasya, she’s not my closest friend, she’s my fiancée, and we’re getting married in Canada.'”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW with Amber Heard ‘s Never Back Down Costar <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">@StevenCrowley</a> who CONFIRMS that Amber ABSOLUTELY does Cocaine & More! <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</a> Get this Exposé out there! 🔥 <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#AmberHeardIsALiar</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#DeppvHeard</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#JohnnyDeppDeservesJustice</a><br>WATCH: <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/6SpC7CVaez</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/fKL3Auth9u</a></p><p>— Andy Signore (@andysignore) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">May 21, 2022</a></p><h2>Crowley On Amber Heard lying in Court</h2><p>Crowley further claimed that Heard perjured herself on the stand in her current court case by lying about not consuming cocaine since she was 18 years old. Heard allegedly gave him cocaine while they were both working on Never Back Down:</p><p>“Never Back Down was my first kind of role in doing something big on that scale and we were all young and we thought we were going to be stars and I was at her place the first time we hung out and she is in the kitchen and she goes, ‘You Party?’ and I’m ‘Oh yeah, I party’ and she whips out some coco-colas [cocaine] and starts doing it and I go, ‘Oh I didn’t know that’s what party meant”</p><p>Crowley then said that he was irritated by the Johnny Depp vs. Amber Heard trial because it was supposedly full of lies:</p><p>“So, when I’m watching the trial and what’s going on, the thing that irritates me the most is simply lying.” At least Johnny Depp is honest about being a flawed alcoholic drug addict, but with her, it’s as if there are so many people who know it’s not real, why isn’t anybody saying anything?”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Amber-heard-1.jpeg alt="Amber heard" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The actor also questioned why she had no text exchanges in which she discussed substances “other than cannabis and mushrooms.” He then said that the actress once observed him smoking cigarettes and supposedly stated that she would rather be hooked on cocaine than smoke.&nbsp;He also said that Heard was once furious after hearing reports about a production company contemplating drug testing after discovering certain problems. Crowley was allegedly informed by her that the move was “stupid.”</p><p>Crowley further said that Amber Heard stated that Tasya Van Ree was anti-drugs and alcohol, and that she had urged the star not to expose her drug usage to her then-girlfriend:&nbsp;“Amber had informed us, mainly me, saying, ‘Hey Tasya’s coming in for the weekend, I probably won’t be able to hang out, and if she’s on set, please don’t mention anything about anything.'” She is sober and does nothing.”</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiqrZ2mmrtur9GorqWdqWLAsbvKnmSamp%2BqwW6tzJucq2WYmq6zsIycppyZmaOybsHSnmSappRiv6a4wK2gqKajnbaxedaiq6FlpJbAuq2Mr5inZaKasnA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ugo-humbert.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ugo Humbert [2023 Update]: Early Life &amp;amp; Net Worth">&larr;
