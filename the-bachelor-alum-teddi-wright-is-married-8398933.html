Wright exclusively told PEOPLE she wanted her ceremony to include her nearest and dearest as she prepared to walk down the aisle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It was really important to us that our wedding feel intimate, that everyone that was there was someone who was significant to us in our journey either separately or as a couple," she explained. "It turned into a weekend party to celebrate our love with friends and family!"</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Teddi Wright marries her fiancé Nicholas.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Stephanie Lynn</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For the theme, Wright and wedding planner <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>CMG Weddings and Events</a>, went with a classic black and white color scheme with plenty of candles and flowers used for decor. The reality star credits her florist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Edgar Martinez Ruacho</a> for adding an extra dash of magic to the ceremony by finding her favorite flower, peonies, even though they're currently out of season.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Wright shared, "I was very hopeful to incorporate peonies into my day. Somehow my florist worked his magic and I had the most beautiful peony bridal bouquet!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for her dress, Wright opted for casual elegance in a gorgeous gown by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Grace Loves Lace</a>. The white satin dress featured a "timeless and classy" high neckline in the front, and a low back – a "sexy" detail that the Bachelor alum loved.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I just felt so confident in it and like a bride when I put it on and I knew it was my dress right away!" she said.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Teddi Wright walks down the aisle with her groom.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Stephanie Lynn</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to the bride, one of the most unforgettable moments from the big day was the first look. Wright told PEOPLE she and Nicholas used the opportunity to read their handwritten vows to one another before exchanging their traditional vows at the altar.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We were both so nervous, so it was so nice to see him ahead of time and just remember that these moments are what it is all about!" she shared.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For Wright and Nicholas, nothing was more important than including their family in their wedding. Her father-in-law served as the officiant, while both her and the groom's siblings played major roles in the ceremony, as captured in photos by her wedding photographer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Stephanie Lynn</a>.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Teddi Wright with her bridal party.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Stephanie Lynn</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"All of our siblings were in our wedding," she said. "My brother walked my mother down the aisle. His brothers were in the groomsmen party. My sister was my maid of honor and walked down the aisle with her husband and two sons as the ring bearers - they looked so cute in their tiny suits!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Her other sister and her sister-in-law also walked down the aisle with their husbands and their daughters, who served as flower girls "in tutus and flower crowns."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It was really special for our siblings to have these roles as it felt like seeing the love in the generations that came before us walking down the aisle before I walked down to my now husband," she added. &nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Nicholas with his groomsmen.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Stephanie Lynn</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After the ceremony, guests sat down to a plated dinner of chicken and steak. For dessert, there was a vanilla-flavored "vintage style heart cake," as well as a lemon cake and a s’mores bar for guests to make s'mores by a bonfire as the evening went on.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Our wedding was everything we had wanted it to be and so much more, definitely a dream come true and a day we will remember for the rest of our lives," Wright said.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Teddi Wright at her wedding reception.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Stephanie Lynn</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Wright — who starred on season 26 of The Bachelor and season 8 of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Bachelor in Paradise</a> — first announced her relationship with Nicholas on Instagram on Jan. 1.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The reality star shared a video that began with a clip of her crying and ended with several shots of her with Nicholas — posing with him for a photo, doing his makeup and sharing a kiss — which she captioned, “First new years kiss ever!! happy new year 🫶🏽 #2023.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Just three months later, the Bachelor in Paradise alum shared that she and Nicholas were engaged.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She revealed the exciting news in an Instagram <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>video</a>, including a glimpse at her Jean Dousset-designed diamond ring and a montage of some of the couple's happy moments.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"So this is love … 🤍💍," she began the announcement.

"Now let's get me married 💪🏽"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After announcing her engagement, Wright also shared Nicholas’ name for the first time — and a bit about her husband-to-be.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He doesn't have social media and he doesn't fully understand this world," she revealed in an Instagram Story post at the time. “But he tries his best to be supportive and take a million pictures lol.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She added, "Will try to get him on camera more but wanted to protect our relationship in the beginning! I think the kids call this 'private but not secret.'"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Wright also teased that the pair intend to have a "short" engagement, much of which she went on to document on her Instagram account.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>'The Bachelor' alum Teddi Wright and her husband, Nicholas.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>teddi wright/Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>PEOPLE's free daily newsletter</a>&nbsp;to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In June, she shared a bit more about how she and Nicholas met — revealing that she initially told him a little white lie about herself.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Alongside a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>carousel</a> of photos of herself and Nicholas outdoors, the reality star wrote, “When we first started dating he told me he liked to hike so I told him I was a huuuuge hiker (in my defense I was talking about beach walks).”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“The first month of our relationship he took me on a rly hard hike thinking I’d be fine,” she continued, adding that “crawling up a mountain is when I learned the importance of not lying in relationships 🫶🏽.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From there, Wright began counting down to the wedding, sharing that she is in her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>“lover era”</a> alongside the pair’s engagement pictures. “A lifetime of this 🫶🏽,” she captioned some of the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>shots</a> in October.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6Sdsm6uwJyfnqSfp3qiuNSmZK2dlJm2bsPRop6hrF2ewG65wKupop2UYoV0hZdyamw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./matt-walsh-anti-trans-bigot-previously-defended-josh-duggars-molestation-of-his-sisters.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Anti-Trans Bigot Previously Defended Josh Duggar's Molestation of His Sisters">&larr;
