He was 33.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The singer's wife Kelsey <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>announced his death</a> on Instagram Wednesday, saying that Parker died earlier that day with his family by his side.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Our hearts are broken, Tom was the centre of our world and we can't imagine life without his infectious smile and energetic presence," she wrote. "We are truly thankful for the outpouring of love and support and ask that we all unite to ensure Tom's light continues to shine for his beautiful children."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She concluded, "Thank you to everyone who has supported in his care throughout, he fought until the very end. I'm forever proud of you ❤️💫✨❤️."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Parker and his wife, who married in 2018, are parents to daughter Aurelia Rose, 2½, and son Bodhi Thomas, 17 months. In Kelsey's post, she shared a black-and-white portrait of her husband, as well as a sweet family photo of four.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Wanted <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>posted their own announcement</a> as well, sharing that they were able to be by Parker's side as he died.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Max, Jay, Siva, Nathan and the whole Wanted family are devastated by the tragic and premature loss of our bandmate Tom Parker, who passed away peacefully at lunchtime today surrounded by his family and his band mates," it read. "Tom was an amazing husband to Kelsey, and father to Aurelia and Bodhi. He was our brother, words can't express the loss and sadness we feel. Always and forever in our hearts."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The "Glad You Came" singer was diagnosed with a brain tumor in the summer of 2020, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>shared the news that October</a>, saying at the time that he knew "something wasn't right" but "never expected it to be this."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We are all devastated but we are gonna fight this all the way," he said in an Instagram post. "We don't want your sadness, we just want love and positivity and together we will raise awareness of this terrible disease and look for all available treatment options."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He opted not to learn his prognosis upon his diagnosis, and said in October 2021 that he typically receives medicine every two weeks, but was able to push it to every three weeks because he'd been "responding so well" to chemotherapy and radiotherapy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Still, Parker revealed that his illness had taken a toll, affecting both his short-term memory and mobility.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In November, he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>announced</a> that his tumor was "under control" and he was stable, which prompted "such a mix of emotions."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We couldn't ask for more really at this point; a year or so into this journey," he wrote. "Honestly over the moon. We can sleep a little easier tonight. Thank you for all your love and support over the last 12+months. Love from Me, Kelsey, Aurelia and Bo."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Tom Parker.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>BACKGRID</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It won't be long until we announce NED(no evidence of disease). Trust Me when I say, we are knocking this out the park in the next couple of months 💪🏻💪🏻👊🏻," Parker <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=noopener>added on Twitter</a> at the time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In early March, he shared on Instagram that he'd been <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>seeking treatment in Spain</a> over the last few weeks.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The star maintained a positive outlook throughout his cancer battle, and offered fans an intimate look at his life in October in the documentary <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Tom Parker: Inside My Head </a>— which chronicled his initial diagnosis and treatment — sharing what he wants "from the future."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"More time with my kids. More time with my wife. More time with life," he said in the film, which aired in the UK. "And I feel like that's going to happen. I've got that positive outlook on life. And I think when you take strength and courage from other people around you, that really helps."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>The Wanted.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Larry Marano/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The documentary also chronicled his efforts to organize a charity reunion concert featuring his former bandmates, which took place in September.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He joined The Wanted — comprised of Max George, Siva Kaneswaran, Jay McGuiness and Nathan Sykes — in 2009, and the band found success in the U.S. with hits like "Chasing the Sun" and "Glad You Came," which peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though the group split in 2014, their reunion was an emotional one, and Parker called it "beautifully special."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"There was a moment where I thought I was going to break down and have a meltdown," Parker told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>E! News</a> after their performance. "But the boys just comforted me — it was just an emotional night all around, even for the whole day and stuff."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The band reunited once more for a brief "Greatest Hits" arena tour across the U.K. this month, which Parker joined as he was able.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My happy place," he captioned an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Instagram</a> photo of himself on stage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Earlier this month, he shared that he will be <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>releasing a book in July</a>, that is "not about dying" but about "living [and] finding hope in whatever situation you're dealt, and living your best life no matter what."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ52qwKqvjrCYp6yVmXq0tc2gnKtlpKS6brzAq6Keql2ZsqKwjJqenmVjaHqouMiomaWZo6m8rq2O</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-louisa-krause-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Louisa Krause Dating Now">&larr;
