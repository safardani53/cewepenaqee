Janie, his mother, struggled to provide food and shelter for her children. It was tough for her to even provide for their basic needs.</p><p>Drugs and criminal activities were rising in his town, and Evans was also influenced by it. Because of these, Evans fell into the trap. He started to sell drugs under the name “slim.”&nbsp;</p><p>Evans used to make a certain amount from the deals and provide for his family. It helped in fulfilling basic needs. But his job as a drug dealer did not last long as his cousin got arrested. And Evans was shocked by the event. Soon he realized that it was a risky job, and he could get imprisoned for it.&nbsp;</p><p>Eventually, Evans left the job and focused on his high school. His focus shifted toward basketball during his high school days. He attended Woodham High School in Pensacola, Florida, and his journey as a basketball player started.&nbsp;</p><p>Evans joined Coffeyville Community College for the first two years of college and moved to Iowa for the final two years.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>Read about <strong>Furkan Korkmaz: Career, Net Worth & Achievements</strong></a></p><h2>Reggie Evans: Career</h2><h3>College Career</h3><p>Evans joined Coffeyville Community College in 1998 for two years.
