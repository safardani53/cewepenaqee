The Melrose Place star also appeared on an episode of the actor's show Two and a Half Men.</p><p>In 2015, Charlie announced that he was HIV-positive, and his former co-star / friend posted a heartfelt message on Instagram.&nbsp;"My heart hurts," she captioned an Instagram pic of the two posing on the red carpet together.

Well, we immediately followed her advice.&nbsp;In 2006, Heather filed for divorce from then-husband Richie Sambora, and just a few months later Denise began dating the guitarist.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>According to Denise, their romantic relationship began after Richie's split from Heather. She told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a> in 2006 that a relationship was “the last thing [she] was looking for,” adding, “it’s true when they say things happen when you least expect it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Denise also claimed that she and Heather were not "best friends," telling the outlet, "She was a close friend in the last couple of years. I hadn’t known her my whole life (like) people (are) portraying this.” She also insisted that the two got together following the end of their marriages, saying, "We didn’t meddle in marriages and anything like that.”</p><p>Additionally, she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly told Us Weekly</a> that the former couple bonded over their shared divorces. "We (Denise and Sambora) were friends and we were both going through divorces, and that's what drew us to each other ... I did not steal someone's husband. Did I date a former friend's ex-husband? Yes. Did I break up a marriage? No." Denise claimed.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>She continued, "If I was still friends with [Heather], that never would have happened with Richie. There was no friendship anymore prior to Richie and I getting together."&nbsp;</p><p>However, Denise and Richie's romance ended in 2007, but rumors surfaced that the pair reconciled in 2011 before ending a few months later.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Denise nor Heather has publicly addressed the reason for the end of their friendship. However, Brandi Glanville, who was at the center of a feud with Denise during Season 10 of RHOBH, told Andy on Watch What Happens Live that Heather reached out to her in support of her claims against the former soap star.</p><p>"Heather just reached out to me and said 'thank you' with a bunch of hearts and prayer [emojis]," Brandi stated. "It just made me feel like I was probably bringing this side of Denise out for everyone to see, and I wrote back, 'Of course, the truth always comes out,' and she wrote a bunch more hearts."</p><p>She continued, "And then I said, 'Hey, you should be on Watch What Happens Live with me,' and she said, 'I've already had a cease and desist from Denise, so I'm not going to do it.'" &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnbKiwMeeqWakn5i4rbHAq2SappRisKmt0aWgnmWjnbKmuoyrnKWZpJ68r7%2FHoqc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./princes-death-being-investigated-by-dea-w205324.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Princes Death Being Investigated by DEA">&larr;
