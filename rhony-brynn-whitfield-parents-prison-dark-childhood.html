The circumstances were not good," the relative said.</p><p>"I know Jill always loved Brynn, it was just her lifestyle. She just didn't take care of her properly.</p><p>"I mean, there maybe was a shortage of food at times. It got to the point where something had to be done."</p><p>The young adult at the time placed her children for adoption and then went to prison, the relative claimed.</p><p>The U.S. Sun attempted to reach out to Jill for comment and she did not immediately respond to calls.</p><p>The U.S. Sun also reached out to Bravo and Brynn.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/sad-past-rhony-newbie-brynn-836866497.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/sad-past-rhony-newbie-brynn-836839876.jpg><h2>MOVING ON</h2><p>After giving her children to Darlene, Brynn's mother, who was a manager of an apartment complex at the time, "hardly ever saw" her daughter.</p><p>She started a new life, broke up with her boyfriend Alton after he allegedly "kicked her to the curb," and then married another man.</p><p>She welcomed four other children with her current husband, but Brynn was not close to her half-siblings, per the relative.</p><p>The relative explained: "As far as I know, Jill's doing all right.</p><p>"She hasn't gotten into any more trouble or anything, but the time that elapsed between being with the children [and in prison], it was just too much.</p><p>"I think Jill did try to communicate with [the kids], but it just never worked out. They were separated for too long."</p><p>The relative continued: "[Brynn and her siblings] already established themselves with [Darlene] and she sent them to good schools, and they had a decent life. They had a good life."</p><p>"Bryn was very close to her grandmother.&nbsp;They communicated by phone. And she loved her very much."</p><p>Brynn's grandmother sadly died on March 2021 at the age of 81, according to her obituary.</p><p>Per the relative, there was no funeral service that reunited the family because it was during Covid times.</p><h2>CITY GIRL</h2><p>As far as Brynn's adult years, she become distant from her family after she graduated from Purdue University and went on to pursue her career in New York City and Los Angeles.</p><p>The relative believes Brynn's brother Daris lives in South Korea, and has been there since he pursued his career as an English teacher after college.</p><p>Meanwhile, her sister remains in Michigan.</p><p>Since making her debut on <a href=#>Real Housewives</a>, Brynn's relative has been supporting her from afar.</p><p>"Brynn was always sweet. She was always a sweet girl. Very likable, very personable, very well-spoken," the relative shared.</p><p>"She's a beautiful girl. She was even approached by a modeling agency when she was in Chicago and she had a portfolio.</p><p>"Brynn just enjoyed being free and doing her own thing."</p><h2>OPENING UP</h2><p>At the end of Sunday's episode, during <a href=#>"Brynnsgiving"</a> at <a href=#>Sai's $4.7million brownstone</a>, the PR expert talked more about her traumatic childhood.</p><p>"We lived in “Section 8 housing. It wasn't a good situation. We were poor as f**k - welfare, food stamps, everything," she revealed to her castmates - including <a href=#>Sai De Silva</a>, <a href=#>Ubah Hassan</a>, <a href=#>Erin Lichy</a>, <a href=#>Jenna Lyons</a> and <a href=#>Jessel Taank</a> - over dinner.</p><p>Brynn further claimed she suffered from "abuse and neglect" and "I wasn't picked up for six days, or my diaper wasn’t changed."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"I think it's fine we talk about how hurt I was because I'm so focused on the fact that the two people that were supposed to love me didn't, or couldn't. Couldn't, not didn't," she later told producers.</p><p>New episodes of RHONY air on Sundays at 9pm ET on Bravo.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/sad-past-rhony-newbie-brynn-836853531.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/sad-past-rhony-newbie-brynn-836853611.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/sad-past-rhony-newbie-brynn-836853453.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwZ26FcoCRaKmhp56ueqO%2B2KelZq%2BYnsGntcSlm2aokaeyr8DSZqeroaOku26wwKuiZpuYnrmltM6om2g%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-kid-mero.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Kid Mero">&larr;
